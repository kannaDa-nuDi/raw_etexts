The *DGā\XGGKDP (The Duel of the Maces) is a NāY\D composed
in classical Kannada literary style at the turn of the eleventh
century CE. It is written in FDPSū, a genre that developed in the
tenth century as a mixture of poetry and prose. Ranna’s poem is
remarkably dramatic in nature and is a meditation on the cost of
war. &risp dialogue, body gestures and imagery fill the poem. It
is as if the poet were giving us directions for a play.
   Ranna employs µÀashbacks’, a techniTue called VLPKāYDOōNDQD,
that is, a lion turning casually to glance behind him. Ranna builds
up to the duel through characters recalling episodes of injury or
through lamentation. The duel occupies only a short space in the
eighth canto, but Ranna takes this time to fill in past episodes
and reÀect on the impact of war. This thousandyearold poem
will interest scholars as well as lay readers.

             Kannada Language Chair



Instituted in November 2015 by the Department of Kannada and
Culture, Government of Karnataka, Kannada Language Chair of
the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi is dedicated to
promote excellence in teaching, researching and publishing on
language, literature and culture of Karnataka in all its multilingual
and plural manifestations. The Chair encourages comparative
studies across a wide range of domains and also aims at dis
seminating knowledge of Kannada language, literature and culture
both at national and international levels.
   The Chair has taken up translation projects with the objective
of rendering into English a whole gamut of classical and non
classical Kannada texts of seminal nature. This process has been
initiated with the translation of three major texts of tenth century –
.aYirāMaPārJa‫ ۦ‬of Srīvijaya, Va‫ڲڲ‬ārādKaQe of Sivakōṭyācārya
and *adā\XddKaP of Ranna.
   The current book *adā\XddKaP is a celebrated classical
Kannada text written by most powerful poet Ranna of tenth
century. He is known as one of the ‘three gems’ (raWQaWra\a)
and also given the title ‘the emperor of poets’ (kavi cakravarti).
Ranna retold 0aKāEKāraWa on the model of Ɩdi Kavi Pampa’s
ViNraPārMXQaViMa\aP.
   Most of the critiTues treat *adā\XddKaP as a static text, so
lidified in time and space. However, this popular text is not just
a ‘text’, but expanded itself over the centuries to become a family
of literary and performance traditions in Karnataka, yielding to
the social imaginaries and the historical aspirations of artists,
sculptors, musicians, and many others. Such multiple narratives
should have been a part of understanding *adā\XddKaP text.
x          A NOTE FROM THE KANNADA LANGUAGE CHAIR


   There are hundreds of sculptural representations of Bhīma and
Duryōdhana fighting each other on the banks of Dvaipāyana lake,
carved on the walls and pillars of temples in Karnataka. The
fifteenth century poet, Kumāravyāsa once again recreated
*adā\XddKaPin Bhāmini Saṭpadi which helped the text to reach
out vast audience through singing and also helped the performers
of JaPaNatraditionto reach much wider audience. The medieval
harikathā tradition also made Gadāyuddham a popular episode
among common folk. During the early part of twentieth century,
*adā\XddKaP has been rewritten for yakṣagāna performance
which transformed the classical text into a living text for the
benefit of contemporary audience.
   Thus *adā\XddKaP has created a complex interrelationship
between living texts, recitations and performances which needed
to be discussed intensely by the scholars.
   Translating such classical texts into English is a challenge
beleaguered with difficulties. Leading scholars of classical
Kannada, R.V.S. Sundaram, Ammel Sharaon and Akkamahadevi
have jointly accepted these challenges and made translation a
possible. I thank all of them for their industriousness and com
mitment. I consider this an auspicious beginning paving the way
to more translations of the same text for years to come.
   The generous support of Kavi Cakravarti Ranna Pratishthana,
Mudhol, Karnataka makes it possible for Kannada Language Chair
to publish this book. I thank them for their support!
   I am thankful to Manohar Publishers & Distributers for taking
this onerous task of publishing the daring translation of a monu
mental Kannada work.

             A Note on Transliteration



Transliterating a regional text like *adā\XddKaP reTuires special
attention. It varies from transliterations of Sanskrit texts, which
do not fit the case of Old Kannada and other Dravidian languages.
Since Kannada has both long and short letters, ē and ō are
employed to differentiate them.
    There are special sounds and letters like ۜa (retroÀex lateral
sound different from ‘Oa’), ‫܄‬a (trill different from the Àap ‘ra¶)
and a peculiar sound, now pronounced as ۜa and found freTuently
in Old Kannada called ‘raۜa’. These two are denoted as ‫܄‬a and
۠a.
    The aQXsYāra which is governed by certain rules in Sanskrit
is pronounced as ‘P’. But the aQXsYāra replaces all nasals in
Kannada, which confuses the reader who is unable to distinguish
between the masculine singular ending (‘Q’) and neuter singular
ending (‘P’). If the aQXsYāra is used for all the nasals, the singular
‘āQ’ (I) and plural ‘āP’ (we) would be written in the same way,
adding to the confusion. Hence, we have retained the original
pronunciation of the sounds. Nasals are represented by their
respective symbols (‘۪’ for velar, ‘ñ’ for palatal, ‘۬’ for retroÀex
and ‘Q’ for alveolar or dental nasal) while ‘P’ is used for both
the labial nasal ‘P’ as well as the aQXsYāra which is also pro
nounced as ‘P’.
                        Introduction



The *adā\XddKaP (The Duel of the Maces) is a NāY\a, composed
in classical Kannada literary style at the turn of the eleventh
century CE. Based on a single episode in the ĝaO\a 3arYa, the
ninth book of the 0aKaEKaraWa depicting the decisive battle
between the cousins, Bhima and Duryodhana, the *adā\XddKaP
brings the great battle to an end. The poem bears another title,
the SāKasaEKīPaYiMa\aP(The Victory of Daring Bhima).
   However, we have chosen to call it by its popular name,
*adā\XddKaP, which is also the name its poet Ranna uses when
introducing his work in verses 1.32, 33 and 34. Further, the earlier
printed editions also carried this title. The literary critic,
T.N. Srikantaiah published an abridged version in 1949 called
*adā\XddKaSa۪JraKa. B.M. Srikantaiah called his adaptation for
the stage, *adā\XddKa1ā‫ܒ‬aNa. SāKasaEKīPaYiMa\aP, on the other
hand,is the attributed title because it appears in the colophon at
the end of each āśYāsa or canto that summarizes its respective
theme. Since Pampa (90275 CE), considered the ādiNaYi or first
poet of Kannada literature dedicated his work, ViNraPārMXQaYiMa\aP,
to his patron Arikesari II, it is believed that the SāKsaEKīPaYiMa\aP
is patterned along the same lines. Yet Ranna portrays Duryodhana,
the antihero as a heroic NsKaWri\a, a loyal friend and a loving
brother. Hence, the title *adā\XddKarecognizes not one, but two
formidable opponents and heroes.
   Ranna identifies Bhima with his patron, the :estern Chalukyan
king, Irivabedanga Satyashraya who ruled between 997 and 1008
CE. In the second canto, he provides a brief genealogy (YaPśāYaۜi).
Here we observe an attempt to link the :estern Chalukyas of
Kalyana with the earlier Chalukyas of Badami to further an
imperial vision that connects the Kalyana rulers to ancestors in
xiv                        INTRODUCTION


Ayodhya (Narasimhachar 1911; Pollock 2006, p. 155). This link
would soon be standardized in inscriptions and serves as a reminder
that historical records or textualized history are not to be taken
at face value but provide an insight into the changing nature of
selfrepresentation and a concern for shaping public memory.
    Ranna was born in Muduvolal (now Mudhol) in present day
Bagalkot district in 949 CE to a Jain family of banglesellers.
Having studied Sanskrit, Prakrit and Kannada, he was patronized
by a Ganga minister, Chavundaraya, and later appointed to the
court of Ahavamalla Tailapa II (97397 CE) where he earned the
title NaYiFaNraYarWi (poetemperor). He continued in the court of
Tailapa’s son, Irivabedanga Satyashraya (9971009 CE) to whom
he dedicates this work. Remarkably selfassured, Ranna pours
scorn on pretendpoets and challenges readers to evaluate his
work. Other works attributed to him are the 3araśXrāPaFariWaP,
&aNrēśYaraFariWaP, $MiWaSXrā۬aP as well as a lexicon, 5aQQa
NaQda. T.N. Srikantaiah speculates that the &aNreśYara &ariWe,
a lost work by Ranna may have been dedicated to Tailapa II. The
$MiWaSXrā۬aP composed in 993 CE, is based on Ajitanatha, the
second Tirthankara.
    How might we understand the relationship between the Sanskrit
epic and regional retellings of the 0aKaEKaraWa? Are the early
Kannada retellings a part of the IndoEuropean tradition of the
hero? Are they discontinuities that disturb the imagined community
of the primary epic, reshaping it towards ‘new political ends’?
(Hiltebeitel 2011, pp. 423). The period between the ninth and
thirteenth centuries in the Kannada land was infused with the
sentiment of Yīra or heroism (Settar and Kalaburgi 1982). It is
evident in literary compositions of the period as well as the density
and spread of hero stone memorials that recorded warrior bravery
and promised soldiers a place in heaven. Cynthia Talbot remarks
that as the paradigmatic epic of war, the 0aKaEKaraWa was usually
the first Sanskrit epic to be adapted in regional literatures (Talbot
2016, p. 138). This is because, as Sheldon Pollock has presciently
                           INTRODUCTION                           xv

noted, the epic had geopolitical significance and courts endea
voured to produce its idea of the world within their region.
    Pampa, Ponna and Ranna, considered the three gems of classical
Kannada literature, belonged to the Jain religion. The poem’s
religious intent is rather different from religion as we understand
it today. The poem stretches over vast regions the earth, vanTuished
rulers and their kingdoms, and speaking in the same breath of the
heavens and the underworld. :e meet gods, varieties of spirits
and divine creatures like celestial aSsara maidens. The Jaina poets
had to contend with a Vaidika 0aKaEKaraWa which extolled
violence through its heroic characters. Indeed, as Hiltebeitel’s
studies show, the central problem of the 0aKaEKaraWa appears to
be reconciling inevitable violence with the means to bring about
the cessation of violence. Yet the ĝramana Jains would find such
an ideology difficult to digest. Pampa and Ranna give little place
to Krishna in their works. Though Ranna begins his cantos with
invocations to Vaishnava deities, his treatment of Krishna is as a
king and advisor, eschewing the strong EKakWitheme of the Sanskrit
epic. Through Duryodhana, Krishna is freTuently criticized for
his unethical decisions. Nevertheless, the Chalukya crest was the
boar (VaraKaOāñFKaQa), significant because of the oftrepeated
invocation, ‘where the whole earth is said to be sustained with
ease by Vishnu incarnate as the Boar’ (Ramesh 1983). Ranna
appears to negotiate his presence in the court by composing
separate works, the Jaina $MiWaSXrā۬aPand the worldly (OaXkika)
*adā\XddKaP. Ranna employs poetics as a critiTue of violence,
for the heroic rasa (Yīra) of the two warriors is overshadowed in
the poem by EKīEKaWsa and raXdrasentiments – rage and disgust.
    The poetic style of a regional kāY\a like the *adā\XddKaP
was shaped by the second millennium assertion of ‘vernacular’
languages. Across the subcontinent, Pollock says, Sanskrit lost
its eminent place as regional languages came to the fore. The
earliest treatise of poetics in Kannada is the ninth century
.aYirāMaPārJaP(.50). Though it addresses topics of grammar,
xvi                       INTRODUCTION


prosody and lexicon, the .50 endeavours to locate itself in a
particular geographic and cultural setting, an effort distinct from
the ‘cosmopolitan’ literary cultures of Sanskrit and Prakrit
(Srivijaya 2017). Ranna says that Kannada is spoken over two
lands, and the Kannada spoken in Puligere is the true Kannada
(1.42). The (SiJraSKia ,QdiFa records a 930 CE inscription that
says, ‘In the circle of the land of Bharata is a perfect ornament,
the region of Kuntaḷa, and a very gem in this realm is the people
place of Purikara >Puligere@, the Two SixHundred >administrative
unit]’ ((, 13 311, lines 245). It helps to remember that the
relationship between language, land and people has changed over
time. If early Kannada literature is characterized by a relationship
between language and land, the modern history of South India
has seen this relationship recast as one between language and
people, becoming a veritable identity (Mitchell 2009).
   The .50 distinguishes a dēśi Kannada literary style from the
dominant Sanskrit PārJa style. 'ēśi style is marked by a local
‘naturalness’ without the arduous complex forms employed in
Sanskrit literature. Like other poets, Ranna is an XEKa\akaYi, well
versed in both Kannada and Sanskrit. The *adā\XddKaP is written
in FaPSūa genre that arose in the tenth century as a mixture of
poetry and prose. It is only alluded to in the .50 which terms
it a Jad\akaWKa (prose narrative). :ith its long prose sections,
it is a genre wellsuited to reading, and unlike purely metrical
poems, it cannot be sung.
   :hile the Kannada poets were aware of Sanskrit dramas, no
extant drama has been found in early Kannada literature. The first
prose work in Kannada, the Va‫ڲڲ‬arādaQe mentions local dramatic
forms for amusement (Srakara۬a) though there is limited evidence.
Yet, Ranna’s poem is remarkably dramatic in nature. Crisp dia
logue, body gestures and imagery fill the poem. It is as if the poet
were giving us directions for a play. Little wonder then that the
poem was adapted for the stage by wellknown writer, B.M.
Srikantiah in the twentieth century as *adā\XddKa1ā‫ܒ‬akaP. In
an unusual section, the reader will find nine verses on aestheticized
                           INTRODUCTION                          xvii

sentiment (rasa) – erotic, heroic, macabre, humorous, ferocity,
fear, compassion, wonder and tranTuillity – as they unfold on the
battlefield. It recalls the 1āW\aśāsWra, the foundational dramaturgical
treatise in Sanskrit that puts forward a theory of rasa. Following
convention, Ranna refers to the compositions and poets who have
inÀuenced him Valmiki, Vyasa, Kalidasa and Bana – Sanskrit
poets. Those who go unmentioned are BhattaNarayana and Bhasa
whose Sanskrit plays, Vē۬īsaPKāraP and ūrXEKa۪JaP are based
Bhima’s on avenging of Draupadi’s humiliation.
   Though Ranna was a court poet and the composition restricted
to an elite audience, it is likely that the audience was introduced
to it in both, manuscript form and oral form. The arrangement of
the poem in cantos, and the long, robust tradition of manuscript
production implies that the poem was recorded in writing, but the
oral and aural history of texts in India suggest that this poem was
recited in the JaPaka tradition to its audience. *aPaka is a form
of storytelling that continues to be popular in Karnataka. The
recitation is based on the meter of the poem but punctuated
to convey the meaning of the verse. The JaPaki may divide
compound words so that the audience is able to understand and
appreciate the poem better. Music is a freTuent accompaniment
and the JaPaki also attends to the emotion conveyed in the verse.
Interested readers of premodern Kannada literature still come
together to listen to these recitations that today have also been
recorded. Among the most popular of JaPaka performances is
Kumaravyasa’s fifteenth century work, .ar۬ā‫ܒ‬a .aWKā 0añMari
(the .arQaWaka0aKaEKaraWa), an adaptation of the first ten SarYas
of the epic.
   Attending to the poem’s dramatic nature is a way to broaden
our treatment of premodern compositions. Recent studies have
highlighted the performativenature of compositions. The *adā
\XddKaP is no exception. The brevity of the .aQda meter and
directness of its dialogue is unusual in poems of its time that
are characterized by ornamentation and long meters. Draupadi
enters bearing pots on her head in the manner of the .araJa, a
xviii                      INTRODUCTION


folk ritual dedicated to Draupadi as Goddess in South India, which
heightens the dramatic atmosphere. The *adā\XddKaP with its
intense and physically imposing characters is freTuently a subject
of the Yakshagana, a signature theatrical form from coastal
Karnataka which is seen on the jacket of this book. Elaborate
costume and makeup, music, dance and robust dialogue delivery
characterize this art.
   The poem contains 578 verses, too many to dwell on for one
brief episode. Indeed, the duel between Bhima and Duryodhana
appears only in the eighth canto. Instead, Ranna employs
‘Àashbacks’, a techniTue called siPKāYaOōkaQa, that is, a lion
turning casually to glance behind him. Ranna builds up to the
duel through characters recalling episodes of injury or through
lamentation as Duryodhana walks through the bloodsoaked
battlefield, pausing to reÀect on his losses as he comes upon slain
family and friends. :e see a broken, defiant man recall his
loyalties, friendships and frustration in the company of his advisor,
Sanjaya. The poem is dedicated to Bhima, but the reader is struck
by Ranna’s elevated treatment of his SraWiQā\aka, the antihero,
Duryodhana.
   :hat does the *adā\XddKaP offer readers today? This text
certainly benefits from a revival of interest in translations of pre
modern Indian literature. The 0aKaEKaraWa confesses to cover
the entire expanse of human experience and has been the subject
of many new retellings as the Indian publishing industry has
burgeoned. Ranna’s thousandyearold poem is a text of historical
and literary interest, but readers will also find in it a meditation
on the cost of war. :e are mistaken, it reminds us, if we think
history is written by winners. In a startling section, the battlefield
strewn with swollen bodies, is visited by many gangs of spirits
(Àesh eating SisKaFKis and mad ParXOXs) who come hungry and
desiring to profit by selling off soldier’s bodies. :ith Duryodhana,
we witness the effects of war, and no reader will fail to be moved
by his lamentations. Ranna is sometimes dismissed as only a
‘warpoet’, but in our mediatized age where singular heroes are
                          INTRODUCTION                         xix

fashioned through circulating images, Ranna presents us with a
multifaceted view of the battlefield where there are no winners,
but men and women counting their losses. The reader will not
fail to be struck by the irony of the title, 7KeViFWRr\RI'ariQJ
%KiPa for the tale is a cautionary one and one as relevant today,
as Ranna thought it was in the tenth century.

Lakshmi’s Beloved, Baladeva’s companion,
Subduer of Bali’s pride,
ConTueror of Hostile Demons,
Reposed on Anantabhoga,
Protector of Dharma, Lotuseyed One,
the primordial man, an excellent man
This Chalukya Narayana:
May he bless us with welfare and gladness!1            1




He is loved by Prosperity and he is powerful,
he seizes the pride of his strong enemies,
ConTueror of demonic enemies, abode of infinite
pleasures, who rules his kingdom
according to dharma, his eyes are wide like lotuses,
best among men, Vishnu in form,
This Chalukya Narayana:
May he bless us with welfare and gladness!2




The crescent moon is the eternal seed,
Adishesha is the sprout,
His laughter booms as blooming petals,
Nandi is the Àower and Kailasa is the fruit,
Shankara embraces fine faced Gauri
as the Kalpa tree3 does the vine
May Chalukya Narayana4 grant us our desired fruit.     2

Not a trace of arrogance in the sweating rut elephant,
the famous pure %Kadra elephant
is a lion among kings,
his long and beautiful trunk is loved by the world.

Magnificent and lion hearted, not even

The %Kadra elephant is renowned

Beloved of the world whose prosperity is revealed as

The mind fixed on one thought:
after his beloved brother’s death, he vowed
to see his enemy’s head roll. To chase after him –
lift him up – haul him back here
he determined not to bathe till then.
And so, rolling him over, he destroyed him.

$PPaQa*aQdKaYaraQa, the sweet smelling
elephant – how appropriate his name!
Having scaled the hill forts of other cities,
it butts and bends trees to drink their nectar,
it gathers jewels in heaps, then off
to the western coast – it bathes
with a mixture of camphor and ash,
the rut elephant plays!                               27


Furious, he struck 21 times like that Rama of old
who hunted down Kshatriyas.
Now Narendra elephants no longer attack these parts
Aparaditya has gifted him 21 elephants
Had he refused, Emperor Satyashraya’s anger
may have scorched 21 generations.                     28


Enemies prostrate at his feet,
Don’t you know? They are weak, seeking to serve.
He kills –
Illustrious Slayer! He is prepared to battle,
prepared to stake his life.                           29

This composition is the renowned *ada\XddKa
Composed about Sahasabhima
Composed by the jewel among poets, Ranna
How can it be described?                             32




Recognize the fierce animosity that prevailed since
the beginning between Kunti’s celebrated sons –
particularly the strong Bhima – and Duryodhana,
eldest among esteemed Gandhari’s sons.
At the end of this battle of dKarPa, he struck and
killed him. That is why Bhima is the victor
Best among victors. Taking this as his centrepiece
Ranna has composed the *ada\XddKa.                   33




Early on, he approached chieftains
and he rose, he rose by grace of a PaQdaOaking
on the path to prosperity
when in the eternal reign of the emperor,
he came to be the Poet Ranna.                        34




Fame is permanent: it extends across the oceans,
past the cardinal elephants,
crosses the old mountains. Can donors
and their money stand the test of time?
:here are those recipients? :hat of their wealth?
:hy be bewitched by this wizardry?
Ranna is the mahout’s hook for elephantpoets!       35

the native style. It is well known and beneficial.
To ignore it or not take it seriously begs the Tuestion:

Can the poorest in the army camp offer anything?

It is in his delightful scholarship. In his artful poetry!
His conduct is a gem in the ocean of precious gems!21        43

They say the best are among the ancients,
there are no worthy poets now.
Don’t say that – Poets may pass
but their works stand –
:hat is excellent? :hat can be faulted?
See and test on the touchstone
Poetry will speak for itself. May scholars examine
the Tuality of poems, whether old or new.24             47



He that seeks only excellence,
or wicked men who twang bows looking for a fault:
If you really must count
merits and faults, who is to stop you?                  48



The wealthy are not generous,
those clever in speech are not free from envy,
were the generous to be wealthy, and the unenvious be

for scholarship or sharpness. They cannot deliver.

The :ind at the time of dissolution will blow away
the army of the Bearer of the Kuru Earth
like cotton. He is a lion against the sweet smelling
Kaurava elephants. His face red with
Dushasana’s blood, a thunderbolt against
Duryodhana’s mountain thighs who struck
Duryodhana’s jewel studded crown with his feet.
I describe this battlerenowned Bhima, Rama’s eTual.     52



Rival elephants scatter
to become guardians of the directions,
Kings Àee to become the lords of the cardinal points,

Dushasana who rose from the Kurus

unnoticed, is accompanied by Buddhimati her intimate companion

No agreement came about even after Krishna,
enemy of demons, made attempts.
By your merit alone, Suyodhana remains pitifully

This fierce mace shattered opponents in battle.
This terrible battleworn bow striking fear like a raging
serpent – with these three daQdas in hand,
:ould I allow for a reconciliation?                              73



Again, he replied in the same manner,


He is the fire spreading through
the Kuru king’s ocean, the fire in the forest of the
Kuru king, moon to the lotusking,
Indra’s YaMra weapon on the greatest mountain,32
the bright sun dispelling the dark Kuru king;
lion amongst the most excellent elephants,
the Chalukya lion swore an oath before his woman.                74




This is the first canto describing Bhimasena’s oath, in the ViFWRr\
RI SaKasa %KiPa, the Chalukyan Emperor that the Poet Ranna,
Emperor among poets, taking refuge at the holy roots of

warriors, supreme lord, king of poets, ruler of the earth, the refuge

Daring Bhima, powerful in arm is invincible
against his brotherwarriors who seek their inheritance,
for his arm is the Mandara mountain that churns the ocean
of force of the Kuru king to gain Shri, Goddess of :ealth.          1




In this manner he, the fire of Kaala1 for the Kaurava clan, a
Narasimha who played upon the wide chest of the demonborn
Dushasana, a cyclonic wind at the final deluge that uprooted the
pride of the strong treelike brother of the Kuru king, the encircling
roaring ocean of dissolution that drowned the enemy’s mighty
army, a majestic man supported by those terrible arms – on his
mind weighed the vow to break the Kuru king’s thick, straight
thighs. He, the fiery comet tail against the Serpent Flag Bearer,
he causes the Pandava strength to glow, wall of the Pandava fort,
a lone hero who tore Jarasandha’s joints apart, he: the WiOaka of
Satyashraya’s line, illustrious slayer, he is Yama, god of death
dominating the brave soldiers of the enemy camp, Chalukya
Narayana, Chalukya Lion, the Chalukya Sun, of spotless character,
the $PPaQa*aQdKaYaraQa, he, the symbol of audacity is Bhima
sena who in mounting anger has fulfilled his vow.




:ith his savage claws the lion cleaves the forehead
of the rut elephant: Is it befitting to be called an
(QeP\RI'eer? You, who dichotomized Jarasandha:
Does it honour you to be called the (QeP\RI.XrXs?                 2

Oh Illustrious Slayer, Lord and Supreme One,
Daring Bhima! :ho could survive after
causing you injury? Your terrible mace and iron bolt
hack away like sheep being chopped up,
:ounded corpses become food for ghosts in war.
Don’t your fallen enemies proclaim your heroism?             3


So the daughter of Fire praised the son of the :ind,


Both, the body and its ornaments
come to ruin. Fame is the gold that escapes destruction
Therefore, Oh Iridescent Slayer, give away your body
and riches in exchange for everlasting wealth!               4


Do jewels, gold, wealth
and ornaments please wives? Like you, may husbands
demonstrate their merit
by wounding with weapons, Oh Illustrious Slayer!             5


:hen she taunted him in this manner, Buddhimati responded,


He gives to those in need, he protects them
who surrender in fear; :ho but the Illustrious Slayer
is as charitable and forgiving? Is there a crookedness
in his expression, a stammer in his speech?                  6


If you think about it, speech is everything
for these kings, not duty –
I know them well and that is how it is.
Listen, Oh Illustrious Slayer!
Only kings like you fulfil the affairs of state.              7

Then the elderly Kanchuki spoke, ‘Among the ancestral kings
was the king of Ayodhya, the supreme lord Satyashraya who was
the refuge of such merits like truth, whose inÀuence extends to
the guardian elephants of the great directions, and who was also
called Vishnuwardhana, Jayasimhadeva who felled the Rashtra
kuta elephants and received growing love from his people,
Ranasinghasimha who was attractive in battle and loved by his
people, Pulakeshi, the supreme lord of Vatapi city, who performed
the $sKZaPedKa sacrifice, and whose inÀuence spread to the
islands, Keertivarma, who protected the auspicious, became the
king. His son was the second Satyashraya. His youngest son was
Mangalarnava, the ocean of auspiciousness. Another Satyashraya
was the second Satyavrati. His son was Adityavarma, and his son
was Vikramaditya. His son was Durdharamalla and his son was
Vijayaditya Bhattaraka, also known as Niravadya. His son Konkaṇi
Vikramaditya was also known as Vikramarnava. His younger son
was Bhima Parakrama whose son was the second Keertivarma,
and his son was the elder Tailappa. His son was Kundiya Bhima
who killed Mukundi. His son, Vikramaditya had a son, Ahavamalla
whose title was Raṇarangamalla, great warrior. Ahavamalla
married Bonkadevi who belonged to the Chaidya lineage. His son
Vikramaditya was Uttungamalla, a great warrior. [Benediction]
He is the refuge of the whole world, lord of the earth, great king
of kings, supreme lord over kings, the venerable one. He wields
terror over the king of Karahata, decked in ornaments that are his
merits, having noble birthwinning over Jaadhilandhra,2 who
mounted an elephant and won over Pallikota, destroyer of
Bhadraka, a terror to the Konkan, terrifying to both armies, a lion
against enemy dynasty. Terrifying in battle, he smashes the herd
of enemy elephants. He is Kareendra, lion warrior. He is the
Garuda to the enemy serpents, lion to the krakaOi elephant, a lion
who attacks the forehead of the most excellent elephants, the sun
of Yadava clan, terrible in the battle. He is a tiger among the deer.

Tualities, wielding the Vajra weapon against the Ghurjaras, bringing
in them a feverish fear. He is the fire spreading through the Malava

of your kings. Your eloTuent speech is very nice! But where is
Dhritarashtra? :here is Gangeya? :here is the treaty? Dushasana

Duryodhana. To kill and win over him is no big deal for our king.
Do not worry about it.’7 Having said this, he turned to look at

:hat will the other kings, angry and ready to battle
with their bows, do to me?
Could other heroes undertake the burdensome tasks that
I have left incomplete? Are the Pandavas impenetrable?
His proud words have been laid waste
as my brothers and sons died on the battlefield.20        12



He sat about happily,
prattling idly about heroism, then departed.
He did not know to fight with renowned warriors.
Our archery teacher was fit to teach blacksmiths.21       13



:ith respect to the king’s concerns,
:ith respect to fighting against the enemy in war –
I will take care of it, he said
Lies! Neither has borne fruit.
His words have become meaningless.                       14



In the beginning, the PotBorn One
gave Arjuna an honourable place
:hen the relationship began to rot,
He gave up his own breath as a gift to him.              15



Only Kshatriyas have the capacity
to give freely, to strike hard and to offer protection
to one who surrenders.
It is not in the nature of Brahmins –
they know only to say ‘bho!’22 and ‘dho!’.
:hat do they know about fighting?                         16

Among the four castes, the twice born23
have no authority except over the ritual grass.
It is proper for kings born in the [Kshatriya] lineage
to kill their enemies. It is prohibited by birth
[for Brahmins] to take up arms.                          17

‘A teacher’! Oh, sure chee!
‘From Bharadvaja’, sure!
He sided with the Pandavas,
acted out of character for no good reason,
diminished as an expert archer and in birth.             18

My beloved friend, the son of the lotusloved
Surya was by my side, abused
by that man born in a pot
:as he inferior to the son of Indra at all?              19

Think about it, Ashwatthama
is a secret friend of Pandavas.
In prohibitive language, he would say
the son of Tapa is different, and I am different.24
He threw away his weapons of protection!                 20

If you can win, then fight and win!
If you are unable to win, then a heroic death is a
warrior’s distinction.
If you are unable to win or die heroically –
If you Àee, will not fame Àee from you?                  21

Disregarding danger or astonishment
he shoves bands of warriors violently
without protection
For the king who nurtured him,
he offers his life and wealth to clear his debts.        22

Can a warrior sharpen a wooden knife
like a sword is sharpened?
If you patronize a soldier, he will display his courage –
:hat will a coward prove to his master in battle?           23


If he shows no manliness when cattle are abducted
or a woman laments, or when serving his master,
in tensions among relations,
or if a village is threatened,
then he is no man – simply impotent.                        24


Hearing the king speak so harshly about Bhishma and the others,
Sanjaya thought to himself,


A primordial man, the eleventh Rudra, the three eyed one
who loved the daughter of the Mountain Lord,
he destroyed love with compassion,
became Drona’s son for a purpose – when the world
speaks of Ashwatthama in this manner,
How can Pingaksha, redeyed and limited in strength
scrutinize Virupaksha, the abnormal eyed one?               25


He was rescued when the hostile Chitrangada25
carried him off into the sky – He has forgotten
his relative’s deed, in his vengeance.
:ill this Kaurava not enter Raurava hell?                   26


Oh yes! Shakuni is his accomplice in royal affairs,
The charioteer’s son is his valorous companion.
Bhishma and the archery teacher’s words sound bitter,
of course but this is only an amusement of fate
for the culprit with the serpent Àag.                       27

His teacher is his armour. Karna shields his shoulders
The son of the celestial river is his headguard,
Unable to unleash his anger on his body,
Bhima thinks: I will break the Kuru king’s thighs.        28




Dhritarashtra grew into a tree
with a hundred branches.
Rising from the earth, a second fivebranched Pandu tree
does not decay. The first tree
is whittled to one branch because of him today.           29




So Sanjaya looked at the Kuru king,



Respected, bestowed with fitting and famous titles,
He received his divine asWra from Parashurama
befitting a brave man
The Pandavas and Kauravas
saluted him with folded palms
The archery teacher fought against Gandivi:26
You have seen arrows rain down in showers!                30




It is true and proper that he was born of divine Ganga,
and received the king’s grace,
Understandably, his arms have developed an itch,
well suited to the expert archer
How proper for one with a name like ‘Bhishma’,
The son of the Sindhu river demonstrated his
heroism on the battlefield for all to see.                 31

His Majesty belongs to the lineage
of the ambrosiamoon whose eternal rays extend across
the celestial range. At his feet are the immortals.
His tremendous shoulders break down
elephants of the enemy kings.
This is the dazzling fame of the Daring Bhima.                 1



Saying this, Sanjaya described the intrepid deeds of the Daring
Bhima,




Shakra’s son,1 the renowned Bharata hero launched
arrows and Bhima brought down
the army of Kuru king with his terrible club:
the fallen army, fallen horses, fallen elephants strewn
over the Kurukshetra like crushed cumin seeds…
As though Yama had vomited after his meal.2                    2




From the Tuiver, one arrow becomes ten
when he prepared to shoot. :hen they leave
the bowstring, hundred arrows Ày
one thousand break the enemies’ arrows,
in the soldiers’ bodies they turn to a hundred thousand arrows.
Too many to count!
:hat praise for the power of Partha’s bow?                      3

Ferocious Bhima’s mace destroyed
the Kalinga king’s elephants who fall
on the battlefield like terrible hills
destroyed by the thunderbolt.                           4



Like gusts of wind
stirring the trembling rhythm of the ocean waves,
the :ind’s son struck down

Chariot horses move in one direction
The chariots move in another!
See them fallen and vanTuished –
The charioteer is laid out in another direction.
Pritha’s son3 is known for the blow of his mace.        6



Archers lie strewn amongst
scattered swords and spears locked together
On closer look, they have been turned
to a heap of bones by the :ind’s son.                   7



Soldiers slain by soldiers,
horses by horses, chariots by chariots –
the :ind’s son felled the enemy elephants
and destroyed his enemies.                              8



Some   he swallowed delicately
Some   Kauravas he assailed, captured and swallowed,
Some   he split down the front
Some   Maruti cooked for the Lord of Death.4            9

punching with both fists, crushing Baka’s solid body.

the son of the :ind who killed

The Celestial River’s son, the Potborn One,
Son of the Daymaker and others have died in war.
People say Duryodhana cannot win
over the Pandavas alone; he has spread his sari out18
These two: the power of my arms and the power
of my mace will ensure my victory, Sanjaya!
:hy do I need anyone else?                                    47




Having torn the forehead
of the rut elephant like a lion,
I kill my adversarial kings in anger.
:ho would help such a man?                                    48




Karna and the others are gone.
I have no more desire left. :hy do I need help?
Do potdrums19 reTuire the support
of cymbals, drums and other instruments?                      49




Having said this, Duryodhana hoisted his mace – that was like
Yama’s sceptre – over his shoulders, and walked towards the
Pandavas. Despite knowing the nature of the Serpent Flag Bearer’s
anger, Sanjaya protested again fearlessly,



Oh Sun in the Kuru sky!
Nara and Nara’s son,20 your guru and his son,21

Doesn’t Vyasa hold that these six Maharathas

The son of Ina,24 Dushasana,

Nakula and Sahadeva are Ardharatha warriors.

Oh Kuru King! You and the king of Madra, Somadatta,

Hearing Sanjaya’s words, Pingaksha25 grew enraged and responded
cruelly,

You praise the others and snub me
Ey Sanjaya!
Do you think you are another
Archery expert, another son of the Sindhu?                        56



You do not know the power of maharatha
or my own power! Calling me samartha is an insult –
am I not known to you? Is there another
hero like the bearer of the Serpent Flag?                         57



Is it proper to say human Àesh is superior Àesh? To say that Àesh
and fat are superior? To say sacrifice of Àesh is a superior sacrifice?
To call deep sleep eternal sleep? To say that deep breath is life
breath? To call a thorny shrub a superior tree or to say that Bhima
is a maharatha? Sanjaya felt afraid when the king spoke so harshly.




However much he may be instructed,
a king’s true nature remains unchanged,
as tall bamboo/great lineage is thick and tough
on the outside yet hollow on the inside.                          58




He knew what they said, ‘Silence is capable of conveying
meaning’, so it seemed sensible to obey him for it is also said,
‘Do not provoke the honourable!’ Sanjaya remained silent as the
bearer of the Serpent Flag prepared for battle. He watched him
walk toward the battlefield but Sanjaya, who was by nature a
strongwilled fool desiring the welfare of his lord, could not
standby in silence,

Ashvatthama and Balarama
and the other two are part of the army,
yet you believe you can fight the Pandavas
without their expertise with only the strength of your arms! 59


To Duryodhana, Sanjaya suggested that not only Baladeva and
Ashvatthama, but Kripa and Kritavarman also remain. Honour
the four heroes; make them army chiefs and triumph against your
enemies, he said,


It was impossible for the son of Celestial River
Impossible for One Born in a Mud Pot
Impossible for the son of Ina
Do you think Drona’s son is capable enough?                 60

any hope for him in the war – :hy bother

the blind king and Gandhari?                                     70



To this, Sanjaya replied, ‘Dhritarashtra and Gandhari are completely
undone by the death of Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Dushasana,
Shalya, Shakuni, Saindhava, Bhurishrava, Somadatta, Bhagadatta,
Saubala, Brihadbala, Bahlika, Vinda, Anuvinda and the others.
Fall at their lotus feet, relieve their mind’s pain when you go to

I’d go along with the prince and the Anga king

:hile he was speaking, agents informed Gandhari and Dhritarashtra
that he remained king of the seven parts of the kingdom but had
lost the four branches of the army.27 They came to the battlefield
in search of their son, desiring to know his condition and to ease
his mind,


Leader of eleven Kaurava battalions!
You are the consecrated king

come. He informed Duryodhana with folded palms, ‘Lord, your
mother and father have come searching for you.’ Like a lofty
mountain peak struck by Indra’s vajra weapon, Duryodhana bowed
his head in shame.

As Gandhari wept, Dhritarashtra fell at his son’s feet which were
to him like lotuses touched by the tips of crowns of kings of all
countries.


Haa! Jewel crest of the Kurus! Haa! Kuru Emperor!
Ha! Beloved Lord of the Earth!
Has the wicked magistrate of fate
sent you too to the other world in his anger?                    82



You were alone.
All the other princes are dead – O Kuru Nayaka,
Nothing will remain if you do not fight.
The expansive earth will be burden for Shesha.32                 83



Sanjaya pacified the elders’ pitiable laments saying, ‘Your son
has fainted in severe sorrow after the death of Karna and
Dushasana. He will revive in due course. Do not weep.’ At this,
they gathered themselves,


The elders’ tears turned
to sprinkling water and their deep breath
became a fan that awoke
the jewel crest of the Kuru clan from his faint.33               84



He awoke from his faint and saw his parents, overcome by shame
he bowed his head. Then Sanjaya said to Dhritarashtra and
Gandhari, ‘This is your son, the King of Kings, the mango tree
at the centre of the Kuru land who greets you.’ His words were
like nectar, and Dhritarashtra touched him in happiness, rejuvenated
him, embraced him, he blessed the afÀicted man with a hundred

thousand words. Over and over, he hugged him. Quickly, he had
the attendants leave,




Yama’s son may still agree, my little one, give your assent.
I will send Sanjaya to make an agreement:
Set aside your enmity with Bhima.
Do not think of the sorrow of your brothers and sons.
Let them have half the kingdom.
The blind king pleaded with his own son
and clung to his legs.                                       85




And so the blind king reTuested the Kuru king,




Alone, the hero triumphed,
compelling enemy kings to submit,
:ho killed Jatasura, Kimmira, Hidimba, Kichaka,
Jarasandha – heroically, he killed all your brothers
:hy will the Chalukya Lion let you off?                         86




Here ends the third canto describing Dhritarashtra’s speech, in
the ViFWRr\RISaKasa%KiPa that the Poet Ranna, emperor among
poets, taking refuge at the holy roots of .aOSaYriksKawhich are
the holy feet of Srimad Ahavamalla, has composed for Sri
Satyashraya, glory of his clan, foremost among warriors, supreme
lord, king of poets, ruler of the earth, the refuge of men, king of
the world.

The enemy king is won over by the warrior’s valour,
Isn’t the daring Bhima Tuite invincible?                       1

‘Therefore I’m asking you to consider my words: set aside this
talk about battle with him. Come around to what I’ve said.’ These
were Dhritarashtra’s words that Gandhari supported and reTuested
him,

:e are bent with age
and blind in both eyes. It is proper to listen.
Accept your father’s advice, my son,
They say, ‘Don’t pass over the words of your elders.’          2

Abandon your war effort, my son.
Go back to your tent. Our dead boys
are far gone. It is enough if you remain.
Can we bring the dead back?                                    3

As she spoke, Gandhari thought of her departed sons and her
grief returned but Sanjaya reprimanded her for expressing her
sorrow,

You forget you have come to console
your beloved son. You are struck
by grief instead – :ho else
will console the blind king and the king himself ?             4

This Gandhari, mother of a Hundred Heroes –
Today they call her mother of a Hundred Sorrows.
Under the weight of her great sadness,
she is marked out for weariness, O Kuru Lord!1                5


The Ruler of the Earth
saw the annihilation your brothers.
Sorrowful, the son of Dharma desires a truce.
Have you not understood the worthy
oath he has sworn?                                            6


They remain together by good fortune
If one among the four brothers were to die in battle,
would it be a victory
for the son of Yama who is devoted to dKarPa?
He would not survive.                                         7


Sanjaya agreed with the king,


This reasoning is Tuite proper.
Oh King! Grasp what your father is saying.
Hearing him, the King of the Earth said:
The objections that you make
are the basis of my principles!2                              8


If a single brother were to die, among the renowned four,
the son of Yama would offer
his life’s breath to Agni.
Of my renowned brothers,
not one among the hundred remains!
Must I remain alone? I have thrown away
the desire to live! I’d rather be with them.3                 9

He fell at his feet as he turned to face him.

his son and stammering, addressed that king.                    13


In any case, you will not accept my advice. You have chosen
enmity and you will fight with Pandu’s sons. If you do not accept
a truce, do us this kindness at least: Do as you will, but consult
your grandfather. Please go and meet him, he said.
   ‘It will be my fortune!’, he replied. Taking his parents’ leave,
he bid them to return home. His grief kept his feelings of anger
and war at bay for a while. He walked through the battlefield in

The Kuru king found no place for his foot.
Stepping on swollen corpses, he walked on.                 14


Then they saw him,


Assemblies of Àesh eating spirits
had arrived, searching deliriously for thick corpses,
while wounded soldiers stood guard
over their chief’s body,
refusing to let spirits to approach.                       15

The Pillar of the Kuru clan walked on, firm in his purpose.


The Bearer of Serpent Flag is the abode of courage.
As he walked slowly, he gazed at celestial women come

Sanjaya understood what was on the king’s mind,

Heroism is incited when enthusiasm12
is unabated and resolve not forsaken.
Spirited warriors would not leave their positions,
and warriors died because they would not retreat.         24


Hair in disarray, a slack mouth,
a slightly bent neck, eyes shut,
the body washed in blood –
Dead warriors perform a macabre rasa.13                   25

struck the man beside him – spurts of blood

Furious soldiers refrained from killing
those who stood with their faces turned away,
hopeless and without pride
bereft of their weapons with fearful, pitiable faces
They showed compassion and did not kill them.15                29



Behold how the rasa of wonder is created
on the battlefield, as the soldier, strong in the arm,
wields the sword that breaks in two – one blow
to the horses, two blows to the elephants in rut!              30



Pained by strenuous battle, unable to reach
for their weapons, the rasa of tranTuillity settled
in them as their mind attended to the remembrance
of the feet of their favourite god.16                          31




Sanjaya walked along, showing the king the nine rasas in recreated
form,


The battlefield became a dark, frightening day
as fiery swords Àash like lightning
born from rumbling clouds
arrows rain as the great warriors/Indra roared.                32



Fearsome arrows of adept archers
fell in the battlefield like snipped tender shoots.
So too how can the fall of those who stray
from the dharmic path/string of the good bow be
any great wonder?                                              33

Swarmed by arrows/bees,

as if a throng of chariots/host of birds
So proceeded Gandivi’s chariot, frightening enemies
like a new fangled tree created by Yama.17                      34


Adorned with bells, Bhagadatta’s elephant
resembled the sky
a delightful constellation
of stars/a pearl necklace and a beautiful comet/Àag.            35


He embraced the long tusk of the enemy’s elephant,
embracing the long breasts
of celestial damsels at the same time. Is anything
impossible for the heroic soldier on the battlefield?            36


The collision of elephants
gave rise to [blazing] Àames, warriors’ arrows
became fiery barriers and the Àaming discus
appeared to be the Sun’s ring, enemy of darkness.               37


As he spoke in this manner, brains and guts of terrifying elephants
spilt, their heads and wombs pierced repeatedly by arrows shot
from right hands and left. Blood gushed from bodies like the
Saraswati, Àowing in a thousand directions. Enemies in their
thousands faced off, fighting with fierce clubs and smashed crowns
whose gems fell like lights and formed a rainbow. The battle
waged between crores on the two sides, their weapons struck and
the directions dazzled with Àying sparks. Army elephants, horses,
charioteers in the army lost their heads; their bodies danced on
the field, while hungry SisKaFKas, YeWaOsand EKXWasroamed with
wide eyes, clapping gleefully as they watched them dance. They

to the war field where discuses, weapons and crowns filled the
ground, and blood mingled with mud.




Let us eat this a little at a time;
it will finish if eaten all at once, they said,
unable to eat the elephant’s corpse by themselves.
Greedy mad spirits with starving minds
refused to share with others.                              38




Since there was an abundance of corpses,
merchantpishachas had arrived from a far
desiring profit, who were selling
the Àesh of corpses to a group of pishachas.18             39




Brahmin raksKasas proclaimed a new veda –
their clothes turned red with fresh blood,
their sacred thread was glimmering fresh intestine
as they instructed the gathering of pishachas
on consuming Àesh.                                         40

all of it has been sucked by Bhima.
Oh, to drink Bhishma’s warm blood!

Kururaja, I have come

Listening to the pishachi as they walked,


His feet slipped on the ground,
muddy with brainsplatter.
Sanjaya steadied the Lord of the Earth, saying:
At least your thighs aren’t broken!
No, said Duryodhana.
But a lowly mad pishachi intervened,
How will you stay alive, Oh Kaurava Lord?
:on’t Bhima break your thighs out of anger?20                   44


The words of the mad ones were harsh to his ears. He felt shattered
recalling Maitreya’s curse, that his thighs would be broken. He
was extremely strong, so he set the thought aside. ‘Is there any
meaning in the words of a mad spirit?’, he thought dismissively

ones are meaningless’, he thought as he walked a short distance
slowly.


Eh! I swear on Long Haired Dhurjati! I will not

I swear on the warrior Bhima, iI you cross that limit!

They walked across rough parts. Sanjaya showed him,


‘This is where Dushasana who wronged Draupadi
was killed by Bhima.’

:here is this beautiful Vrshasena28
who with his powerful arms cracked
the hostile rut elephant’s head so fearlessly?
who lacerated his opponent’s arrows,
who was no different from my own son.                          64




Looking around as he drew nearer, the king saw Shalya burnt by
the angry fire of Dharma’s son. Bhagadatta, felled by the Vijaya’s
arrows. Jayadratha, laid on a bed of arrows from Gandivi’s furious
bow. Shakuni slain by Sahadeva’s terrible sword. The five sons
of the serpantlike Shatabindu who was impaled like a mongoose
by Nakula’s javelin.29 They were dead: The Nivatakavacha,
talataluka and paulomas, demons of great strength, nobles and
kings of Kamarupa country, sixty thousand crore atirathas, another
eighteen crore samarathas, Susharma and Trigarta who were called
Samshaptaka, Bakasura’s grandson, Jatasura’s children Halayuddha,
the terrible rakshasas, Pestle Bearers, Kala and Nila. He saw
Saubala, Brhadbala, Vinda and AnuVinda. He saw Shankayuddhas
who were the able kings of Kambhoja Sudakshina. He was stricken
with grief seeing them lie there.




These meritorious men are the jewel crests
of the three worlds, great warriors,
eTual to the Kailasa mountain.
Have these children of kings,
assembled to fight, perished because of me?                     65

If I were to speak of prudent conduct,
I’d say come to an agreement.
Don’t fight Kunti’s children. :ar is the abode
of uncountable faults.
It is the place of catastrophe for Kshatriyas.
Esteemed men were unable to convince you reality.
This roaring lion among the Chalukyas, Bhima,
slayer of Hidimba will not remain
without killing you like Yama at the time of Dissolution.    66

Beloved of the Goddesses of :ealth and Victory,
Destroyer of the Kuru clan, who drives
away the enemy’s abundant pride, whose Àag
bears the king of animals –
Is the valorous Bhima of battle any ordinary man?1           1




As he was listening, the king of the Kurus came upon the prince
(Dushasana) who lay in a river of blood caused by Bhima’s mace
like an iron bolt,




Deva! Here, Bhima killed
the Kalinga king’s army of elephants.
Deva! Here, Bhima swallowed
all the Kauravas so eagerly.
Deva! Here, Bhima dipped his face and sucked
Dushasana’s blood.
Deva! Here, Bhima, like a rut elephant, fought
Bhagadatta’s elephant with such determination.2              2




He rolled Dushasana in the dust,
clobbering his Àesh into fine pieces – he ate him.
He gulped his blood down
still the enemy of Hidimba was unsatisfied.                   3

As Sanjaya spoke, as he walked not giving him full ear, he saw
his brother’s eye pecked by crows, his intestines hauled out by
vultures, jackals pulling apart ribs, foxes drawing the nerves,
barking dogs holding the veins, jackals biting at the throat, lowly
pishachis rolling his body in the dust, betalas wringing his back,
terrifying raksKasis breaking his skull with a knife, female prētas
lowered their mouths to Dushasana and wailed because Bhima
had drunk up his blood already. Out of an overÀowing love for
his brother, he chased them away, and unable to control his grief,


:eeping with each step, Duryodhana
gazed at his beloved brother:
He went after his waist and crushed his ribs to pieces!
He pulverized his Àesh as he stomped on him
Then, he tore his chest apart.
He roared as he glugged and glugged down his blood.
How will I abide with my grief if my enemy lives?                4



He stood there, recalling his many griefs,


His life is in another world, his immense Àesh
fills pishachas
His blood lies in the enemy’s stomach. A long nailed
raksKasi cradles his head in her palm.
His body lies in the Kuru land –
Son of Gandhari, Duryodhana’s brother,
Oh Dushasana! Bhima’s terrible club has turned you
into the five elements!3                                          5

The one who killed you is still
alive, isn’t he? I let him live,
making no effort to kill him.
I am still here, aren’t I?
Is it right to not reciprocate your affection?                     6


I drank from mother’s breast, then you had your sRPa.
I relished splendid food and you followed.
In childhood and always, you did not trespass the limits of humility.
Yet you have gone forward into death.
Haa! my little calf, Dushasana!
Battle has turned order into disorder.                              7


The Light of the Kuru Clan lamented,


He drank my brother’s blood –
I will drink his blood together with his life –
My name is Duryodhana!
How else will I erase Dushasana’s indignity?                       8


Then RedEyed One with bloodshot eyes, angered at the sight of
his brother’s body, took his leave,


The Kuru king saw the king of Anga
broken by Arjuna’s shaft
as he walked across that terrifying battlefield,
strewn with corpses of elephants, horses and men.                  9


Bereaved by the death of an adored son and brother, the king felt
his grief swell at the sight of his beloved friend, Karna. :atching
him, Sanjaya thought that it was like a swollen blister on a wound,4

He lifted the chariot’s wheel
from the swallow of the earth,
His feet were so charmingly poised.
An arrow gracefully drawn to his ear by his right fist:
The Lord of Anga leaned against his Àag staff
as though laughing at the unfulfilled duty of the dead,

In whose company will I enjoy the pleasure of my meals?

his elders and Sanjaya’s advice, he came to pay his respects to
the elder one, the son of the River who lay on a bed of arrows.
Gandhari’s son gazed at the son of Ganga,16


His body was subject to celestial weapons
and broken by Arjuna’s innumerable arrows.
Still he did not forget Mukunda,
recalling him several times.
:hat a pitiable condition
the enemy has left the Kuru king in.
How had the supreme yogi become so infatuated?                  38

The resplendent son of the Celestial River
lies there in a repose of weapons.                              39

The king of kings restrained the son of the River’s lament, ‘:e
know you are a devout soul, well versed in these matters. Do not
be so sorrowful.’ He explained why he had come and his decision
to continue the war. Bhishma pondered for a while, ‘My son,
Brahma was born from the lotus in the navel of Vishnu. The seven
sages were born from his mind. Soma was born of the three eyed
Atri,19 venerable in all the world, and from Soma came the lineage
of the Moon. There were numerous kings in the lineage of the
Moon. Among those was King Satya who had a son named
Bharata.20 From him came the Bharata line. In the Bharata line,
was born Pratipa, the incomparable and strong, and to him were
born four sons, Shantanu, Bahlika, Vinuta and Devapiyum. I was
born to that Shantanu and Gangadevi and I have been celibate
since I was young. :ith Yojanagandhi as Satyavati was known,
my father Shantanu had two sons, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya.
In their absence the line was in danger of coming to an end. From
Krishna Dvaipayana’s (Vyasa’s) boons three sons were born:
Dhritarashtra to Ambika, Pandu to Ambalika while the concubine
had Vidura. And so there has been from the line of the Moon no
interruption in that Bharata clan till today. There has been no rift
within the clan until it came to you. Listen to me if you wish.
Make an agreement with the Pandavas. Make a treaty. Let it
continue as it was. I will try too for they do not disobey me. They
do not disagree with me. Do as I say and don’t disagree with me.
Duryodhana just smiled.




My mind is made up.
I have come to offer my respects and leave.
Did I come for advice to orchestrate a truce?
Ajja, tell me what is to be done now.                            45

Bhishma realized that king of kings would go ahead, relying on
his innate bravery. He shook his head repeatedly in wonder,


Even if the seven deep oceans and seven lofty peaks
grow beyond their limit, the king of the Kurus
will not abandon his selfrespect
or give away his auspicious prosperity to foes.            56



As the fire in the lac palace was the seed,
the dreadful poison became the sprout.
A lively game grew into a gamble of tender shoots.
Grabbing the hair of Panchala’s daughter was the Àower;
it grew into a tree of enmity.
The fruit will be the loss of his thighs and crown.
:ill it whither if it is not successful?                   57



Then he decided,


The Storm’s son destroyed the younger Kuru brothers.
His heavy, iron studded mace will break the two
thighs of the Lord of the Kurus into pieces.

Srivadhu reposes in the might
of his powerful arms.
Beloved of the Goddess of Victory, the king
of the Earth is famously called the Daring Bhima.               1




The son of Ganga appreciated him silently,




Pulling out an arrow from his belly
to fashion a Tuill, Sindhu’s son wrote
on a Àag with ink taken from a rut elephant
and sent it to the blind king.                                  2




Signing the letter in his name, he said, ‘My grandson will not
accept my advice. As long as you and Gandhari are alive, urge
Duryodhana, Shining Light of the Kuru Clan, to make a truce to
live as we did before.’ As he placed the letter in Sanjaya’s hands
and sent him to Dhritarashtra, the Kuru king looked at Sindhu’s
son,




The exalted Kuru line is destroyed by disrepute.
I am responsible for its coming apart
Still, I am the Kuru king!
You ask for a truce? Ha! The crown is mine!                     3

These two long arms
are made for heroism;
victory is left to the Gods.
Ajja! I will shine, not stain the Bharata race.                    4


No, let it go, Ajja, I have ended the truce
with a PaQJaOaPaKasKri.1
I will not follow your advice in this instance
It is not wrong to cross over your command.
Please do not insist.
Amazed by the strength of that unmatched boldness,
Mandakini’s son praised him.                                       5


Guru, Bhishma, Arka’s son and countless
great warriors are dead – no one remains.
This singular Kaurava remains alone unshaken.
He will maintain no kinship with Kunti’s sons
Alone and ready to rumble –
Is there anyone who stands like this hero?2                        6


The son of Ganga praised him silently. ‘Time will tell what is
inauspicious.’ Following the adage, he said, ‘My child, you won’t
listen anyway. If you have resolved to fight Kunti’s sons, hide
somewhere till Baladeva returns from his pilgrimage. You must
deceive time till Ashvatthama, Kripa and Kritavarma join you.
Train in the art of the Jalamantra3 and spend this night in the
Vaisampayana lake – it lies to the north of the Kurukshetra, and
tomorrow, well, do as you like.
    ‘That is a big blessing! I agree.’ :ith his advice and instructed
in the Jalamantra, he took leave of the patriarch of the Kuru
family. As he walked towards the battlefield with his mace, he
thought to himself,

The Light of the Kurus muttered as he approached the lake,

He entered the lake backwards covering

Stealing cows, commanding that Krishne
be seized by her sari pleats,
entering a lake backwards
Doesn’t such imprudent conduct suggest
a deformity in the success of the Kaurava state?              10


As he approached the lake,

As though the Sky had fallen, or the Earth had joined
another Earth, or was this a passage to the abode of
the serpent gods, or did Brahma create these waters
for the herd of guardian elephants to bathe?                  11
This great lake and the waters of the Vaishampayana
create such confusion!5

He watched the lotus blossom in the deep, oceanic waters,

Oh, Master of the Kurus! Rivers and all run dry
when you enter them. Bhima is sure to trouble us and
trouble the lake too if we allow such a vile, wicked
man as you. ‘Don’t enter! Stay away!’,
the countless cranes, kRka and ParaOabirds

his hands, feet and face, rinsed his mouth, performed the aFaPaQa,6
paid his respects to the water deities and chanted the MaOaPaQWra




He enjoyed the world of men
His glory is the fortune of the heavens

Exhaling – inhaling – retaining breath

his gaze is half closed in concentration

After Shalya was slaughtered, Duryodhana was not to be found
anywhere. Dharma’s son thought to himself, ‘there ought to be a
reason for this’, and so he consulted Krishna. Bhima, destroyer
of the Kurus overheard Dharma’s son consulting Krishna, Bearer
of the Garuda Àag,

‘A sham is what it is – the oath I swore in the Kaurava court!
Oh, I couldn’t prevent her face
from not turning pale!
The itch in my arms has not stopped;
Suyodhana is still alive – what do I do?’
He, who caused disarray among the Kauravas,
was restless and agitated.                                    16

So unhappy, Bhima desired to powder the Kuru Guardian’s two
hilllike thighs with his pulverizing mace that was like Indra’s
bolt, to cut the Kuru Lord’s arms that were like tree branches
with a deep cleaving axelike mace, plough his broad chest and
render the Bearer of the Serpent Flag into two, shatter his ugly
forehead that was like a stone inscription, knock the jewelled
crown off the man who humiliated Draupadi, powder it under
his feet and with the blood that Àowed from Suyodhana’s chest,
he would Tuench the blazing Àames of his anger. Bhima in his
sparking rage bit his lower lip,

That day, in front of me, he caught her
by the forehead and humiliated the daughter of Fire
I was so inÀamed, I humbled his fat pride!
Can I really wait to finish off the Kuru chief?                   26



Then, the Annihilator of the Kurus, the ruinous comet falling
on the Kuru abode, his face deformed by anger, absorbed in the
death of Gandhari’s son, gritting his teeth, biting down on his lip,
furrowing his eyebrows, with a dreadful forehead – readied to
hurl the family into the many directions. He will be responsible
for the death of the Red Eyed One: his red stare is terrible to
behold, his step is heavy with excitement. He takes his oath with
a roar that is greater than the roll of clouds at the time of the
great deluge – it extends to all the directions.
   He, who finished Suyodhana’s brother and sucked his blood
dry, was spurred by intense anger15 and extended his victorious
mace forward like it were Yama’s staff at the time of dissolution.
He stormed off in search of Duryodhana,


A young elephant in the Kuru banana grove,
A lamp to fell the enemymoth
The son of the :ind has gone
looking for the Kuru chief all over the Kuru land.               27



:hen his Guru would say,
‘You can’t hit the target’, he’d run after the arrow,
Àying with the wind to stop it
Now, he Àies hitherthither at wind’s speed.                     28



He ran forward then back, up then down, twice – three times over,
running pellmell on the Kuru field, elephants like mountains

fell beating against the hard diamond weapon. He lifted elephants
with their metal armour who had fallen on their tusks, searching.
He battered horses with his terrible mace, chopped them into bits,
and with his hands, he scattered the horses from Kambhoja and
Turkey. He searched under chariots, broken and scattered by his
arrows for the man in hiding. He kicked away crowns of fallen
heroes with his powerful feet which threw up a Àood of blood,
jabbing at the heaps of fat, peering through balls of Àesh, looking
between piles of nerves, climbing heaps of bones, through the
slush of brains, separating guts as he searched, stepping on mounds
of teeth, looking through every corner of hills of headless bodies,
listening to each sound like a grammarian, like a hunter he tracked
footprints, like an eagle searches for the serpent’s hood, like a
doctor studying a hostile disease in the body, like Parshurama
who searched for Kshatriyas and killed 21 times, rendering them
childless. He created lakes of foaming blood to make an offering
to his father and mother. Dipping himself in those five lakes, he
looked around at the 48 JaYXdas16 on the Kuru field and burned
with anger for Duryodhana is nowhere to be found,

He loathes Drona and Bhishma’s measured advice,

She wept bitterly at the injustice.                          34


Offended by her words, Bhima, though bitter, paid his respect as
is the convention with elders and proclaimed aloud,


Listen, King Dhritarashtra!
Listen, Oh Mother Gandhari!
I killed your sons – all hundred of them,
struck them with my club.

Meanwhile, the huntermessengers, Vindhyaka and Jalaka, arrived
and prostrated at some distance. ‘Oh Lord! :e have searched all
over the Kurukshetra for Duryodhana but haven’t found him. At
midday, as the Sun beat down on our heads we went to the much
liked Vaishampayana lake for a drink. There we saw prints of a
plough, axe, lotus, conch and a wheel. Those footprints led to the
water but there weren’t any prints entering the water. They
accompanied him to inform Dharma’s son. Vishnu, who presides
over all creation, existence and dissolution listened keenly to their
words and determined,




He entered by chanting the waterspell on the
instructions of the son of the Heavenly River.
He allows time to pass.

Gathering Dharmaraja and the others, the Lotusnavelled One
said: ‘Leave immediately and surround the lotus pond, drag him
out and humiliate him.’ He accompanied Dharmaraja and others
and saw the signs pointed to by the hunter messengers. He reco
gnized the Duryodhana’s footprints without any mistake, and he
was left without doubt in his mind,

The Kuru king’s retreat
is a strategy no Bharata son has chosen,
said Dharma’s son
bowing his head in shame.                                         39

He came howling to the pond’s verge, beating drums, blowing
conch shells, striking kettledrums, blustering on long horns, playing
five different great instruments, and yet he couldn’t lure Duryodhana
out. Then Nakula was called on to shout his name,




They call you Distinguished :arrior!
Moon of the Kuru race!
How can you stay submerged?
Oh Duryodhana, the name you made for yourself
is soiled in infamy in the mire of this lake.                      2




You are not fit to be the handsome slayer’s opponent.
I am Tuite adeTuate and ready for duel. Don’t stay there –
Come out of the lake!
Let me help you to the taste of my spear!                          3

You assumed till today
that death would never be yours.
Oh, Falling Star of the Kuru Race!
You may think so, fate thinks otherwise!1                     4


Let Yama’s son be. Leave Bhima alone –
to soldiers, he is the God of Death.
Leave Arjuna to his white horse. Leave Nakula alone.
If you are truly capable come taste my sword,
you’ll taste the water of the lake!2                          5


Then Arjuna declared haughtily,


They say you’re a man whose pride is his wealth.
Your pride has sullied your honour, Suyodhana!
You are surrounded by crabs, fish and frogs
in this stagnant water. Does a hero reside here?              6


Oh Man of Honour, you are not only a comet
to your army of children and brothers, but beginning with
Ganga’s son you have been a bad omen
for many – The only fallen star for the Kuru Race!            7


Incapable of battling the distinguished
King Kumarankarama, it befits you to fight me
Taste and see –
these unfailing arrows will swallow you!                      8


Dharma’s son came up, and disregarding the injustice committed
by the son of Dhritarashtra, he spoke in accordance with the
dharma of unsullied warriors for the sake of unity between the

Since the beginning, up until this day, there was no
envy between the Bharata cousins. You have
caused trouble without reason and invited death
upon yourself. Your brothers have perished.
You are to blame for the fall of your family.
I am haunted by the sin of killing my own cousins.
Oh Lord of the Kurus! Is a truce not better?
How does it befit you to enter the lake?                       9




Unable to endure these words, Bhima knit his eyebrows and spoke
with great anger, ‘This insect will not come out unless he hears
my voice! I am the right one to address him!’




You hid away during this terrible battle.
I have killed all your clansmen in anger.
as I pursued you. Oh fool! Do you think
you will survive there in the lake?                          10




I relished the blood of your brother
I have relished the sea of your army
Now, the pond’s water will I savour
and then to relish you!3                                     11

afraid of my hideous form, you enter a lotus pond

Oh dear! You’re in the deep,
a Àitting fish in water.
For shame, you abandon your strength, Duryodhana!
&Ki Don’t the dead come back to life?4 Now come
out and take up your weapon, Kuru King!
Fearsome Bhimasena, thunderbolt to the mountains,
who churns the Kuru ocean, is here!                            13

The arrogance you displayed when Hari came
for a truce – what’s become of it?
The passion that gripped Krishne’s hair and robes –
what’s become of it?
Envy that compelled Kunti’s sons to roam
through forests – where is it now?
The terrible Bhima mocked the king of the Kurus.               14

But however he taunted him, he still couldn’t draw him out,

How long will you remain there?
Draupadi’s humiliator! Dushasana’s villainous elder
brother! You are the brave tree felled by a Àood of tears
after the whole family beginning
with Bhishma was destroyed.
Hostile to the son of Yama without reason!
You hear Bhima’s voice but continue to stay.

You are a comet rising as the Kuru clan dissolves.             15

There will be no talk of my strength or my enchanted

They will say that the Bearer of the Serpent Flag
lost his strength that he plunged into the water.             23

Make these Madri’s sons stay away. They’re so weak
what can they do?
Let the sons of Dharma and Hari8 come with Bhima.
Let three approach, even if all five come together
or if the son of Kritanta,9 or the son of the :ind,
or Gandivi come one at a time,
Tell them to come, Krishna – I will destroy them all!          42



:hen the Serpent Flag Bearer spoke to the Bearer of the Garuda
Flag,


The Lotus Navelled One heard
Duryodhana and yelled to Bhimasena:
Duryodhana speaks so meekly – How can you
speak such words in front of me, Bhima?                        43



:ith folded palms, Dharma’s son said to Dhritarashtra’s son.


Refrain from war, stay
calm. Take all of it
not only your share –
Rule over the entire earth – be happy.                         44



O Jewel among kings of the Kuru clan!
Take hold of the Earth’s wheel, set aside
your vengeance. Admit us into your service.
Such base thoughts are unbecoming.
Let our agreement be affectionate.
Brother, rest and be at peace. This is our consolation.        45

At this Bhima Tuipped,


You asked for five villages,
he did not accept your truce you went with.
He is a selfrespecting man who has lost
his sons and brothers – will he agree to a truce?              47


Duryodhana agreed with Bhima,


First, I will kill Arjuna
who executed the Ina’s son. Then the :ind’s son
who killed my brother. Oh Lotus Navelled One!
I won’t desist from matching blow with blow!10                 48


Oh, now you talk like a mediator!
Oh, now to be bedfellows with them!
Oh, now to make an agreement with them!

will I agree to one now?                                       49


He responded angrily at the inappropriate blame the Lotus Navelled
One had levelled,


That day when Jarasandha handed you
a terrific humiliation, you came up stealthily
behind Bhima and killed him.

alone, without companions, like a poor fellow on the verge of

My elder brother, you are a respectable man.
Please listen attentively without anger:
I asked for only five villages for the Pandavas.
He disregarded Drona, Dhritarashtra
and Sindhu’s son. Ask Suyodhana and believe.
The Bearer of the Serpent Flag
does not speak in two tongues.                             59


:hen he said this, Duryodhana said:
:hy are you angry? The Pandavas are not at fault!
I did not agree then. Did I ever speak of an agreeable
relationship with them? My children and
brothers are dead and I have seen sorrow.
How can I bear even a moment?
:hatever my enemies deal, I am prepared.                   60


They will watch me fight –
Be sure of this – not another word!
Baladeva, carrying his pounding stick,
applauded the Kuru Lord silently.                          61


Sankarshana praised the undisputed hero, the king of kings.
Speechless and surprised at his determination, he looked at
Dharma’s son and said, ‘Any one among the five may fight and
if Duryodhana wins, he will rule the kingdom and the remaining
four will serve him.
At this, Bhima stepped forward,

Let Dharma’s son be.
Leave Arjuna out,
leave Madri’s renowned sons alone.
I am ready to destroy this wicked man.
Oh Halayuddha! Show me that Kaurava!14                     62

The :ind’s son responded to Krishna, son of Rohini and looked
toward Yuddhishtira, son of Dharma and the others for permission
to duel,


It is known that I am the Kauravas’ foremost enemy.
It is not proper for you

He has been my eTual from the start.                         63


And so, Dharma’s son and the others arranged a dKarPa\XddKa
between Maruti – an Indra whose Vajra weapon breaks down the
Mountain of the Kuru clan, and the Bearer of the Serpent Flag
who wickedly oversaw the sinful indignity committed with
Panchali’s hair,

For Sri Ramani I make my chest an abode,
thought the daring Bhima,
the comet bringing ruin to the Kurus
as the duel was about to begin.                                  1




Eager to fight, daring Bhima thought of Dronacharya paid his
respects to him, and Duryodhana paid his respects to Baladeva.
The superior mace was thirty aQJXOa1 in length with a circumference
of a thousand angula with a tip of eight angula. The medium
mace was twentysix angula in length, a hundred angula in
circumference, and four angula at the tip. The inferior mace was
eighteen angula in length, thirtysix angula in circumference, and
two angula at the tip.
   As they are supreme heroes, Bhima and Duryodhana chose the
superior mace decorated with gold gilding that extend to ten
angula. There were five stances:2 aOidKa, SraW\aOidKa,saPaSada,
YaisKQaYa, and PaQdaOa. There were four kinds of strikes: hitting
on the left, the right, outside and inside. There were eight ways
to hit: YiOaPEiWa, aakXQFKiWa, aasSKRWiWa, aaksKiSWa, XdEKraPiWa,
diJEKraPiWa, XFKiWa YirXddKa, aFKiQW\a. They stood in a wide
field. They were adept in these techniTues and assumed the wide,
YaisKaka stance,

His right leg retreated to block his mace
Bhima and Duryodhana: how appealing their beauty is!

Bala, the Lotus Navelled One and spectators watched

fought without regard for the future.                  14


On the feet, lower thighs, upper thighs
buttocks, trunk, chest, neck

Raising their feet off the ground, they stumble,

This one is for burning the house of lac!
This one for the poisoned food fed with illwill!
This one for cheating at dice!
This is for humiliating Panchali!
This for inviting us to the assembly of deceit!
Bhimasena hit him mercilessly with his mace,
in five places for his five wicked deeds:
on his legs, arms, wide chest, cheeks
and on the centre of his head.                                 19

He hit him without a care,

The Earth trembled under their feet,
The guardian elephants retreated from the horizons,
Hurling maces confused the Vid\adKaras
who parked their vehicles some distance away.
The battle between Bhima and Duryodhana
appeared like Bhairava’s roar at the world’s end.              20

Fiery sparks Àew as their maces rubbed against each other, the
sky was filled with smoke like a burning comet falling, like
whirling leaves Àying in all directions, clouds shone like meteors

lay coiled like Nagaraja exhaling hot air, causing the waters to
boil the fish in the seas – the terrifyingly wondrous battle was on
the boil.




‘Duryodhana’ – how appropriate the word!6
Bhima fulfils his name!
Surely, Bhima is ‘Duryodhana’ and the Kaurava is ‘Bhima’

The :ind’s son informed Dharmaraja
and sent a messenger to fetch Draupadi to show her
the man shaded by the royal umbrella
who brought on the deadly night for the Kauravas.              44



Oh Lotus Faced One! The man who in his fury fed us
poison, desired our death and won the game of dice,
that wicked man who caused your braids to fall
and pulled at your waist band with his brother –
that traitor who went astray, that mean man,
that low fellow, this sinner – look at him now!                45



Daughter of Fire! In the blaze of the ritual sacrifice,
Dharmaraja is the consecrator,
the four of us perform the rites, the killer of Mura
is the preacher, while you took the vow.
Your humiliation fans the fire,
the Kaurava Lord is sacrificial animal.
I offer the Fire of my fury to make this sacrifice possible.    46




The Kaurava’s fresh meat is a good offering;
it has satisfied my burning anger.
I have taken my ritual bath in the blood that gushed
from the intolerable beating
Duryodhana’s body suffered.                                    47

The enemy has met his death, braid your hair!
Smiling, Panchali said: I have forgotten to tie my hair!
I’ve been out of practice!
Oh Sattiga, my shelter of truth,
You have vanTuished the enemy, now braid my hair!                      48

O Krishne! They have all perished by this hair:
men with powerful arms and jewel studded crowns
who conTuered ksKaWri\aenemies by force in battle,
who live with Viralakshmi in heroism
whose mouths were purified by the sRPa nectar
See here, this hair of yours –
is it not Yama’s noose for the Kuru Lord?                              49

Krishne! Decked in Àowers,
she aroused Smara, god of love.13
That loveliness, that manner, her form, grace,
reputation, her Àush beauty and pride.
The corners of her eyes twinkle charmingly!
Her discernment and distinction, that ambrosiac smile!

Doesn’t our Daring Bhima dwell in happiness?                     1




At this happy time, Chakri, the Mover of Time learnt of the arrival
of Ashvatthama, the incomparable hero. To avoid any grief, he
had Dhrishtadhyumna, Shikhandi, Chekitana, Yudhamanyu,
Uttamauja, Shrutasoma and the other Pandava sons watch over
the camp, sending them to Hastinapura with elephants, arrows,
chariots and infantry. The Bluelimbed One took the five Pandavas
to the Nila mountain, home of wild animals, lotuses, fish, lilies
and white lotuses. Meanwhile, Bhishma informed Ashvatthama
of the repose of the Kaurava lord.




Ashvatthama2 arrived in a rage:
Dark throated with the crescent moon on his head
a fiery third eye, bow in hand, bearing a bull
on his Àag, accompanied by Kripa and Kritavarma                  2

You destroy fathers and sons
You cause brothers to Tuarrel. You destroy
relationships between teachers and students!
Killer of Dharma! Is anyone as wretched as \RX?              7


‘Oh but not just that, you were born with that Airavata in the
churning ocean and so share his extreme temperament, born with
the moon there is a stain on your character too, born with the
Kaustubha jewel made you hard, born with Vagdevi made you
garrulous, born with the enemy of the gods you are inclinded to
grab, born with Vaidya5 you inÀict pain, born with Narada made
you Tuarrelsome, you are an assassin because you were born with
the .aOakXWa poison, born with intoxicating arrack you are also
arrogant, born with celestial maidens gave you wanderlust! You
are just like your family!’


They worship you but you will not bless them.
They entreat you but you do not listen.
They stand before you but you do not look at them.
You dismiss the worthy – Are not the afÀictions of kings,
your wicked doing, O Lakshmi?                                 8


You do not side with the admirable,
but prefer the undeserving.
Distinguished men are counted together
with the wicked, O Lakshmi,
Don’t these vile Tualities exist because of you?              9


You support men with sullied reputations
but neglect the faultless
Rust appears where water settles on metal mirrors
So it is also with your arrogance.                           10

There, the orders of the demon’s enemy
Here, she is pulled by Rudra’s incarnate
That side a tiger – this side a river in spate –
Lakshmi was confused,
she couldn’t decide which way to go!                          16



Lakshmi was a hot bother, her hair in disarray because he grabbed
her dark curls and dragged her, as if she were a servile Kuru
potbearer, to Suyodhana who lay contracted and writhing having
been struck by Bhima’s mace which broke his thighs and who
kicked away his crown.



Blood oozed and Àowed
from his cleaved head. Streams of blood ran down
his face – he Àoated, bobbing
up and down, in an ocean of blood.                            17



Dazed by the terrifying mace
of Kunti’s son,
the Kuru king lies in yogic stillness
in a gush of blood, dispossessed of his thighs.               18



The Kuru king did not groan from the pain in his thighs,
a common man would cry out

He was tormented by his humiliation.                          19

on their rounds with brute force. He seemed like Yama holding
his spear as he attacked women and children without discrimination.
He killed them all, wiping off an entire battalion. :hen he came
up against Dhrishtadhyumna, who taunted and humiliated his
father, he brought his vengeance to an end. He sacrificed him to
the directions! He killed Shikhandi, Cakitana, Yuddhaman,
Uttamauja and the others. Mistaking Sutasoma and others for the
Pandavas, he slew the heads of the young Pandava sons. Then
he raced away as the Sun rose, and said, ‘Look! I’ve come with
the heads of the Pandavas who humiliated you.’ He placed them
before Duryodhana. The noble man gazed at the heads for a long

This is not the head of the :ind’s son.

rotund bellies who could barely move. Soldiers waited their turn,
greedy soldiers blocked people’s way, vile fellows ran away
gritting their teeth, heroic opponents prepared to fight the fearless,
genuine heroes sought no one’s help, heroes come from far and
near going about their jobs, heroes carrying their king’s command
without Tuestion, aged heroes counting their victories, illustrious
heroes, men who fought with minds intent on their enemies, heroes
who fulfilled anything asked of them and armies who fought

others, intent on attaining the next world, was ready to breathe
his last at the end of the day.

In the beginning, Shantanu’s son fought for ten days,
Drona, the archery teacher fought for five days
The son of Bhaskara fought for two days,
Shalya fought for half a day
The duel of maces filled the remaining day.
This is how it went,
The terrible Bharata war came to an end.                    36




The war began when Bharani ascended
on the thirteenth day of the first
fortnight of the month of Margashira.
On that day of the Amavasya of the
Mula star, the Kaurava line ended.7                         37




So, the Bharata race was relieved of the burden of war,



Beloved of Victorious Lakshmi, Adorned by valour,
Speaker of truth, Adored by benefactors,
Beloved of earthly folk, :ithout desire for vengeance,
Refuge of scholars, Bearing the radiant mark
of kingship: Shridevi and Bhudevi
came to join the Chalukya Kandarpa.                         38




The Earth blessed him happily and Shri showered him
with auspicious rice and he received them with great pleasure.
He embraced the Goddess of Victory with his right arm
The Chalukya king pleased all three women.                   39

Beloved of Shri, Jayashri and Dharashri,
Goddesses of :ealth, Victory and Earth
the Daring Bhima shone in all the worlds
and his fame extends to the horizons.                      1




The killer of Mura, pleased with the Daring Bhima’s valour in
the victorious war, looked at Dharmaraja,




The Kuru king’s sins caused Arjuna’s terrible
arrows to cleave Saindha into two, crush the bodies
of the oceanstrong army, Karna to meet his death by
a spear. Shalya too was killed.
Brave Bhishma lay on a bed of arrows.
The Bharata war was the victorious
Kumarankarama’s warfield.                                   2




Headless horses, heads of men, torsos of great heroes
scattered elephant heads, warriors with horse faces,
Vinayakas are seen, a warfield of Kinnaras1 –

Arrogant enemies lie on the field, blood mingled
with mud. Arrows toppled the heads of kings
and headless trunks danced – how terrible!
Celestial beings shower Àowers attracting bees.
This is Kumaranka Rama’s warfield –
the abode of the EKXWas!                                      4

:ith his terrible mace, Bhima ploughed the Kuru
field like Bhairava,2 watered it
with the blood of kings, sowed fresh pearls
from foreheads of fallen elephants and reaped
a crop of pure fame like the silver hills.                    5

Kumaranka Rama felt ashamed to face
men who stuttered, did not fulfil their promises,
or were released from battle –
he would not look at them!
:hen the vine of fame extends so far,
what can I say of his three Tualities,
his courage, charity and truthfulness?                        6

The ocean is the boundary of the earth,
the ocean’s limits are the eight directions.
Elephants stand at the end of the directions.
His fame extends to the oceans, to the directions
and the guardian elephants.
Kumaranka Rama’s fame stretches a long way.                   7

Sattiga’s fame sprouted on earth,
spread to the directions,
it touched the sky, watered
by the tears of his enemies’ women.                           8

Having praised him, Krishna looked at the face of the VanTuisher
of the Kuru line,

You vowed to kill your enemy against whom you raged.
You have fulfilled your promise.

Certainly, you mean more to us than the Pandu king.          13

To the Friend of the Lotus was born the Anga king,
You were born to Dharma, the enemy of Baka
to the Fire’s friend, Gandhivi to the Surapa.4
I gave birth to the Daymaker’s son. Karna is my first
born son and your elder brother.
My passionate attachment to you prevented me
from revealing it. I killed my son, O Dharmaja!              21


Dharma’s son and the others were extremely pained at her words
and said,

So the child of the Sun was the eldest brother
in line – :hy did you not tell us?
Had you spoken earlier, the kingdom
would have been his. He would rule,
we would serve him and live in prosperity
but you were wrong in your deed.
In this way Kunti’s sons reproached Kunti.                   22


As Pandu’s sons grieved, the Purushottama incarnate related many
similar examples, taught them the secret of ksKaWri\a dKarPa,
and consoled them. Regaining their balance, they stacked the
bodies of Duryodhana and others and employed Brahmins to
perform the last rites. They had Karna’s body brought there and
placed him over the other bodies. :ith Brahmin priests, they
performed the rites themselves with sandalwood and other
perfumed materials. They built a WeerWKa for Karna and offered
ritual water to send him to the other world. Then with their
permission, Kunti, Gandhari, Dhritarashtra and the royal Tueens
went to the forest to perform austerities.

    offers praise to the gods, the poet’s patron and poets of the tradition.
    Ranna’s patron, Emperor Satyashraya (9971008 CE) is referred to as
    Chalukya Narayana.
       Anantabhoga is the serpent with innumerable hoods who resides
    below the earth.
 2. The opening verse is a sOē‫܈‬a, a mode of punning in South Asian literary
    traditions containing two meanings, simultaneously. In this verse, praise
    is offered, simultaneously, to Vishnu and to Satyashraya, the Chalukyan
    emperor.
 3. .aOSaYriksKa is the wish fulfilling tree in Indra’s garden.
 4. This verse praises Shiva. But Ranna suggests that Ardhanarishwara
    embraces Gauri. Since he calls his patron Chalukya Narayana, so it
    suggests that the other half is Narayana (Vishnu). Ranna describes Shiva
    as Harihara (Shiva and Vishnu). Half of Shiva is Parvati and half of
    Shiva is Vishnu.
 5. Brahmi refers to Saraswati who sits on the tongue of Brahma.
 6. This sOē‫܈‬a refers to the god Brahma and the king Satyashraya.
 7. Dedication to Surya is rare in kāY\a. Even though the Chalukyas are
    said to be from the lineage of the moon, there are inscriptions that also
    claim their lineage from the sun (Parbhani copper plates, vol. 13, Issue
    3, Quarterly Journal of Society of Indian Historical Research, Poona).
 8. The invocation is to the goddess Durga. The poet plays on the word
    kXrX which means to love as well as to sit as well as kūrasi which
    means sword.
 9. Manmatha or Kama is the god of love.
10. Conventionally, the body is described as ornamented in sixteen ways
    while poetry, according to Bharata has thirtysix ornaments.
11. Ammana Gandhavarana refers to a special kind of elephant.
       This sOē‫܈‬a verse refers to the god Ganapati, leader of the Ja۬as as
    well as the king Satyashraya.
12. The GhurjaraPratihara dynasties ruled over North India between the
304                     NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION

    seventh and eleventh centuries, from Ujjain and later Kannauj. However,
    in this verse, Ranna may be referring to the Chalukyas of Gujarat. Some
    Rajput clans claim their descent from these dynasties. The connection
    between the Ghurjaras and the Chalukyas of Gujarat is still a matter
    of debate.
13. Parashurama vowed to kill all Kshatriyas and bathed only after he
    fulfilled his vow. Kuvarankarama is the epithet of Satyashraya.
14. The story refers to Markandeya who was about to be killed by Yama
    but is spared when he embraces a Shivalinga.
15. The practice of standing on an anthill is not Tuite clear. However, the
    oldest extant work on Kannada poetics, the .aYirāMaPārJaP also
    mentions an anthill in the same context of surrender,
      An example of overstating one’s excellence:
      Throw away your weapons. I will not kill you.
      Bite the grass. Step on the anthill.
      Prostrate before me. Either get out of this place,
      or roar like a lion and take up a weapon. (3.199)
16. <XJa in puranic lore is an epoch or era within a fourage cycle
    (caWXr\XJa). A complete Yuga starts with the saW\a\XJa, followed by
    the WrēWā\XJa, the dYāSara\XJa and the present kaOi\XJa believed to
    have begun at the end of the .XrXksKeWra:ar. In this conception, the
    perishable universe is created by Brahma who also takes birth and dies.
    The period between the birth and death of a Brahma is called a
    PaKākaOSa. Each day in Brahma’s life is a kaOSakāOa. Each kaOSa is
    divided into fourteen parts and each part is ruled by a Manu. Each
    Manu’s reign is called a PaQYaQWaraP, and each one has seventyone
    caWXr\XJas.
17. It implies that the sun rose in the east.
18. The poet using the term EāKXrāKX, to mean an astrological body that
    causes the eclipse. In Puranic lore, Rahu and Ketu were born from the
    severed throat of a Brahmin who stole the aPriWa nectar from the gods.
    The Brahmin’s identity was revealed by Surya (Sun) and Chandra
    (Moon). Hence, Rahu and Ketu swallow the Sun and Moon when they
    can, but since they were born from two ends of a severed throat, the
    Sun and Moon are able to emerge from their grasp and become visible
    again.
19. 0ārJa (:ay) was formulated by Dandin to express the diversity of
    Sanskrit styles while emphasizing its unity of Sanskrit literature. 'ēśi
    refers to a local style marked by a directness and grace without the use
                         NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION                         305

       of complex figures of speech. The .aYirāMaPārJaP theorizes this
       difference.
20.    The verse provides us with historical information about patronage among
       the :estern Chalukyas in the tenth century CE.
21.    Jaina authors emphasize conduct (cāriWra), not simply biography.
22.    It is said that Ranna belonged to a bangleseller community who work
       with precious stones in Mudhol, Karnataka. This is a biographical detail
       woven into the kāY\a. The hoods in this verse refer to scholar critics.
23.    The literary techniTue employed here is siPKāYaOōkaQa, the casual
       glance the lion throws behind him as he walks along. In poetic
       convention, it refers to Àashbacks within the narration.
24.    Refers to Kalidāsa’s work, 0āOaYikāJQiPiWra:

        the judgement of another.)
 25. Dikkumaris are celestial maidens in Jaina literature.
 26. Kanchuki is a character in Sanskrit drama, usually chief of the palace
      inner chambers.
 .araJa is a traditional rain ritual, generally performed by women

      Draupadi. Here too, Draupadi appears to have a wish she would like
      fulfilled.
 28. Ranna identifies Bhima with Satyashraya in the previous verse while
      continuing to provide biographical information about him.
 29. Refers to Yama, god of death.
 30. The verse recalls Bhatta Narayana’s seventh century play, Ve۬īsaPKāra
      whose dominant mood or rasa is Yīra or heroism.
 31. Ranna employs a rare metre here, the Navanalina, or lotus metre.
 32. Fires are named according to how they arise, for example: Eā‫ڲ‬aEāJQi
      (fire from within in the ocean), dāYāJQi (a forest fire).
         In poetic conventions, as in this verse, the moon is the enemy of the
      lotus that blooms in the day.
         In Puranic lore, the YaMrā\XdKa is Indra’s weapon made from the
306                     NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION

      backbone of sage Dadhichi, though the weapon is also mentioned in
      the ‫ۿ‬JYēda. Indra used his weapon to cut the wings of mountains which
      become immobile from then on.

 6.   The Yidū‫܈‬aka is the court jester and companion of the king in Sanskrit
      drama. The figure of the Yidū‫܈‬aka can be traced to Bhasa’s plays.

      meaningless.
 8.   Maruti is Bhima, son of the :ind. The name usually refers to his
      brother, Anjaneya.
 9.   The Yidū‫܈‬aka is often represented as having a large appetite. Generally,
      people with a large appetite are mocked.
10.   Vasus are the eight elemental attendant deities of Indra and Vishnu. In
      the 0aKaEKaraWa, the Vasus steal the sage Vashistha’s cow who curses
      them to be born on earth as mortals. They reTuest Ganga to be their
      mother. She will later become the Tueen of the King Shantanu. Ganga
      drowned each child to liberate them except for the eighth, Dyaus who
      lived as Bhishma.
11.   Refers to Drona.
12.   The 0aKaEKaraWa is described as an ocean by poets including Pampa
      and Nannaya (Pampa’s VikraPārMXQa ViMa\aP, 117; Nannaya’s Ɩdi
      3arYa, 113.
13.   Karna’s representation as a loyal friend continues to be a popular trope.
      South India has tended to be sympathetic to his character, with many
      ‘superhit’ films including 7KaOaSaWKi(Tamil, 1991), 'aaQaVeeraSRRra
      .arQa (Telugu, 1977) and .arQaQ (Tamil, 1964) made on him.

18. Ashwatthama Tuarrelled with Karna who was made chief during the
    war, and threw away his sword. This incident is recorded in Vē۬īsaPKāra.

    do not fight with them.
22. Bho here means ‘yes, Sir’, Dho means alas!
23. Here referring to Brahmins.
24. Ashwatthama appears to be making a distinction in birth between himself
    and Karna.
25. This incident is also mentioned in Bhasa’s play 'ūWaYāk\aP, Arjuna
    rescues Duryodhana from the clutches of the JaQdKarYa, Chitrangada.
26. Arjuna is also called Gandivi because he possesses the Gandiva bow.
27. Ganga is an auspicious river. .aOasKa is a water pot used in rituals, im
    plying a strange but auspicious birth. The kaOasKa is also the pinnacle
    of the temple.
28. Draupadi is called Krishne here as well as in the 0aKaEKaraWa. The
    sYa\aPYarawas a practice of choosing a husband from among a number
    of suitors by a girl of marriageable age.

    a Brahmin, who has lost all his sons, pleads with Arjuna to save his
    tenth son. Vows to fight Yama, the God of Death.
30. Madana’s enemy is Shiva who gave Arjuna the celestial Pasupata
    weapon. The incident occurs in the Ɩra۬\aka3arYa, the third book of
    the 0aKaEKaraWa.
31. In this verse, the author uses k‫܀‬Wa cleverly and finally says he is
    k‫܀‬WārWKa – which means he fulfilled but also that he made it meaningful.

33. :e may note that Sanjaya is unable to wake him and Duryodhana

Canto Four
 1. Bhatta Narayana’s Ve۬īsaPKāra also describes Gandhari as a mother
    who has begotten a hundred sorrows (also in VikraPārMXQa ViMa\aP
    14.8).
 2. 8SaSaWWi is a term used in Indian logic to mean proof. The term is used
    by Gandhari in Bhatta Narayana’s Vē۬īsaPKāra. Here Ranna employs
    it for Sanjaya who attempts to inÀuence Duryodhana.
 3. Recall mention of Yudhishthira’s oath earlier. Here Duryodhana responds
    to that oath and defends his desire to die in war.
 4. Arjuna received the name Phalguna based on the time of his birth, when
310                      NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION

      the moon passed through two starclusters (Purva and Uttara Phalguni)
      on one day. Phalgunis are famed for entertainment and friendship.
         Ranna’s phrase, EasiriQWeJeYeQX, probably refers to the more common
      Kannada phrase, KR‫ܒܒ‬eaOOii‫ܒܒ‬XkR۬‫ڲ‬X(literally, to put them in the stomach),
      hide some Here, Arjuna ‘swallowed’ Karna while Bhima swallowed
      Dushasana. The suggestion, following previous verses, is that Yudhishthira
      would be unable to survive the death of his brothers. Ranna chooses
      his words carefully again, employing the epithet Yamaraja instead of
      Dharmaraja in this verse of deadly vengeance. Duryodhana, being close
      to defeat, does not mind joining Yudhishthira in death in such a case.
 5.   The verse refers to Duryodhana’s deceit in the game of dice. Every
      time Yudhishthira threw the dice, he gambled away part of his kingdom.
 6.   The signs are considered auspicious.
 7.   $EKiPāQadKaQaQ (he whose wealth is his pride) is Pampa’s epithet for
      Duryodhana.
 8.   The term for celestial women here is sXrasXQdari. Celestial women are
      often depicted on hero stones carrying fallen warriors to Indra’s abode.
 9.   Vidyadharas, literally ‘wisdomholders’ are supernatural beings who
      are said to attend to Shiva in the Himalaya, but are also found in
      Buddhist and Jain sources. They appear in numerous sources where
      they milk the Earth and learn the art of Àying.
10.   Death is mixture of the macabre and the erotic for warriors. This heaven
      for heroic men is called YīrasYarJa.
11.   5asa literally means juice or taste, but in Sanskrit aesthetics refers to
      aestheticized sentiment. In this verse, the base emotion (sWKā\īEKāYa)
      of raWi(eroticism) is transformed into s‫܀‬QJāra, the first of the nine rasas
      and refers to the erotic.
12.   8WsāKa(enthusiasm) is the base emotion which gives rise to Yīra
13.   Ranna, the war poet, dramatizes death. According to aesthetic convention,
      death is not meant to be performed on stage. Here, Ranna presents the
      EīEKaWsarasa the rasa of hideousness.
14.   This is Kās\arasa which is the rasa of humour.
15.   This is karXQa rasa (pathos) whose sWKa\īEKāYa is sōka (permanent
      separation). But after the Buddhist intervention, karX۬ā (compassion)
      also became a rasa. The .aYirāMaPārJaP also considers karX۬āto be
      a rasa since the author Srivijaya was a Jain. This does not conform
      with Bharata.
16.   Unlike Bharata’s eight rasa classification, Ranna includes sāQWa rasa
      as the ninth rasa.
                       NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION                            311

17. 3aWri also eOe has the meaning of wheel 3aWri here might refer to
    Chariot, rather than to arrows.
18. Madras text of the manuscript refers to ‘merchant pishachas’.
19. Guṇadhya is author of the %‫܀‬KaWkaWKā, a large collection of tales. He
    is known to have composed his work in a Prakrit language called
    Saisāci. The intertextual reference here is to ask whether the poet would
    not be aggrieved by these pishachis who have decided that they too
    can write poetry.
20. This verse has a suggestive Tuality where Sanjaya restrains Duryodhana
    while simultaneously speaking of a future occurrence where his thighs
    will indeed be broken. It is as if Sanjaya prevents the narration from
    closing abruptly.
21. Ranna calls the battle between Arjuna and Drona a union between
    lightness and a heavy weight. It mirrors what in Kannada prosody is
    called ‘JXrXOaJKXsaQdKi’. Kannada metrics has short (OaJKX) and long
    (JXrX) stresses.
22. Refers to Shiva’s bow.
23. Refers to Dhrishtadhyumna, meaning strong by birth.
24. The suggestion here being that his enemies die but his students survive
    in war.
25. The verse implies that he was a hero from childhood. Many folk stories
    there is a motif of mothers feeding their child and telling them heroic
    stories.
26. Bhishma is the great patriarch who led the Kurus for the first ten days.
27. Duryodhana’s son is not mentioned in Vyasa’s 0aKaEKaraWa. This is
    likely a folk inÀuence.
28. Refers to Indra
29. Karna’s son.
30. Nakula also means mongoose.


Canto Five
 1. Srikanta refers here to Vishnu, the husband of Sri (Lakshmi). Vasudeva
    is an important part of the Jaina tradition too. Satyashraya also patronized
    sPārWas who worshipped both Shiva and Vishnu, but are partial to
    Shiva.
 2. Here, Sanjaya tries to capture Duryodhana’s attention by taking Bhima’s
    name first, and repeating it continually, marking a shift away from the
    previous chapter of lamentation.
312                    NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION

  3. -īYaPāPsa, rakWa,śira, kā\a are five parts of him that correspond to
      the five elements: S‫܀‬WKiYāSasWēMōYā\Xrākāśa
  4. The Sanskrit phrase, Ja۬‫ڲ‬as\ōSarisSKō‫ܒ‬akaP, recalls a common Kannada
      phrase too, adXkXrXYiQaERkke.
  5. Duryodhana addresses Karna, his intimate friend, as Lord of $۪Ja
      country. Even in death, Duryodhana addresses him by this royal epithet,
      bestowing honour on his friend, whom it was commonly known, was
      the son of a charioteer. Ranna emphasizes this honour by repeating the
      last word of the stanza in many verses in Duryodhana’s lament. Pampa
      provides the characteristic features of each character in his poem, where
      he describes Karna as having QaQQi or the Tuality of friendship,
      QaQQi\RۜiQaWaQa\aQ. Ranna uses Kannada words to suggest intimacy.
  6. ‫ۿ‬Wa is the Vedic word for truth. Kannada uses words like sXOOX and
      asaW\a for aQ‫܀‬Wa. Conventional usage determines that ‫܀‬Wa has to be
      followed, unlike words like not QiMa or saW\a.
  7. Refers to Krishna.
  8. This curious verse refers to the truth of Karna’s birth, which Kunti hid
      from the Pandavas. Here too, we may refer to Pampa’s verse, 9.66
      where he explains how Duryodhana came to know that Karna was
      indeed the eldest Pandava and son of Surya, the Sungod.
  9. The weapon refers to the fire weapon which was given by Shiva.
 10. The Earth held fast to Karna’s chariot.
 11. Refers to Surya.
 12. An advisor is a QarPasaciYawho appears in other matters as well.
 13. Ranna provides us with different words for advisors in this verse.
 14. The suggestion lies in Karna’s full Moon face being the reÀection of
      his father, the Sun (Wara۬iWaQa\a). Since the Moon inÀuences the tide,
      the memory of Karna causes Duryodhana’s grief to rise.
15. .arX۬a rasa with sōka as sWKā\īEKaYa is the early form of Bharata’s
      rasa theory. It later transforms into karX۬āunder the inÀuence of the
      Buddhists. Sanjaya realizes that death has cast a shadow on Duryodhana.
      To pull him out of his grief, he turns him in the direction of Bhishma.
 16. The emphasis is on the elevated birth of Bhishma as compared to
      Duryodhana’s birth from Gandhari, a mortal woman.
 17. Popular term for grandfather.
 18. Dhavala is a folk song with native metres.
 19. Atri is known as one among the seven vedic sages, and also appears
      in the 5aPa\aQa and 0aKaEKaraWa epics.
 20. Some assume Bhārata belongs to line of Dushyanta and Shakuntala’s
      son. Here Bharata’s father is called Satya.
 21. This verse is like a sXEKasKiWa (adviceliterature).

Canto Six
 1. 0aQJaOaPaKāśrīis a metre which is the final among Y‫܀‬WWa metres which
      have up to 26 syllables. 0aQJaOa means auspicious and the metre is
      sometimes used at the end of epics. Here too, PaQJaOaPaKāśrī is used
      in the sense of an ending.
  2. Ranna puns on the word ‘śēṣa’ meaning the remaining one. He uses
      the word with different prefixes to give different meanings.
  3. Bhishma taught Jalamantra, literally waterspell, to Duryodhana which
      enabled him to hold his breath under water.
  4. 0aWWar is a measure. Ranna follows VēQīsaPKāra where Duryodhana
      hesitates to enter the lake, taking one step forward and four steps back.
  5. This verse is usually acknowledged to be a key verse in the *adā\XddKa.
      Ranna may also be inspired by Bana’s .ādaPEarī which contains an
      elaborate description of the acccKōdda lake.
  6. The ācaPaQa is a ritual practice of sipping water for purifying purposes.
  7. This verse is present only in the manuscript of the Mysore Institute of
      Kannada Studies, Mysore University. The next verse appears to be an
      interpolation.
  8. The god of the western direction.
  9. Refers to the gods.
 10. The world under the earth is called SāWāOa. It is constituted of seven
      realms known as aWaOa, YiWaOa, sXWaOa, WaOāWaOa, PaKāWaOa, rasāWaOa and
      the lowest one, called SāWāOa is the abode of the snakes.
 11. The cosmological term is EraKPāQ‫ڲ‬a.
 12. Ajatashatru refers to Yudhishthira who has no enemy.
 13. This expression is significant. In the Virā‫ܒ‬a3arYaof the 0aKaEKaraWa,
      while the Pandavas are in hiding in their final year of exile, Bhima is
      tempted to uproot a tree when Susarman threatens the Virata king but
      is cautioned against doing so by Yudhishthira.
 14. This line recalls the first act of Bhatta Narayana’s VēQīsaPKāra.
 15. :e may speculate that the mention of Rudhirodgari and allusion to the
      red eyed one (also, Raktakshi) may refer to the final years of the 60
      year calendar. These years allude to destruction and follow each other.
      Perhaps Ranna is speaking of the closeness of the cousins as well as
      the dissolving years that spell an end.
 16. Dimensions of the Kurukshetra battle.
17. $k‫܈‬ōKi۬i refers to an army constituted by elephants, horses, chariots
      and soldiers.
 18. Shiva’s enemy is Manmatha, the god of love.
314                   NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION


Canto Seven
 1. A common proverb that persists in Kannada till today: QīQXRQdaQQQa
    EaJedareYidKiWāQRQdaQQQaEaJedaWWX – man proposes, god disposes.
 2. In Kannada, a show of strength is popularly expressed as QiQaJe
    QīrXkX‫ڲ‬isWīQi or <RXZiOOEecRPSeOOedWRdriQkZaWer
 3. This verse recalls Sage Agastya who drank the oceans up to expose
    demons hiding in the waters.
 4. In Canto 5 v. 64 – Duryodhana says this to Bhishma. Now Bhima asks
    the same Tuestion in this verse.
 5. Subraya Bhat (1956, 7.18, Commentary) notes that Ranna’s home town
    is famous for peanuts.
 6. T.N. Sreekanthaiah suggests that this verse is popular in Kannada
    literature for its suggestive Tuality (%KāraWī\akāY\aPīPāPse, 4th edn.,
    1973, p. 199).
 7. Duryodhana is comparing Bhima to Hiranyaksha. This verse recalls
    Hiranyaksha, brother of Hiranyakashipu, who rolled the Earth like a
    mat, tucked it under his armpit and went to rasāWaOa. 5asāWaOa is the
    lowest level of nether regions inhabited by serpents.
 8. Hari refers to Indra in this verse.
 9. Kritanta refers to Yama, god of death.
10. Ranna borrows this phrase from Pampa in whose work we find, QērSi۪Je
    QērSXJRۜۜadePā۬eQ (11.7).
11. Ranna plays on the word ‘Janaradana’. Janaradana is an epithet of
    Vishnu to mean one who protects people. Janardana can also mean one
    who has caused harm to people.
12. Krishna took the form of Mohini in the distribution of ambrosia.
13. Krishna killed Shishupala with his discus and the elephant that Kamsa
    sent his way.
14. The word dKarPa is usually said to be untranslatable. Here, Ranna uses
    the word a‫܄‬a in place of dharma. Though not used in Kannada today,
    $‫܄‬a is also a Tamil word meaning dharma.
15. Bhima is called the middle born/PadK\aPa, likely inÀuenced by Bhasa,
    the Sanskrit playwright who wrote the wellknown Sanskrit play,
    0adK\aPa V\a\RJa. Bhima is the second among the five sons, but
    among Kunti’s sons, he is the middle son.


Canto Eight
 1. Angula, whose common meaning is finger is a measurement eTual to
    eight \aYa millet grains.
                       NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION                          315

 2. These poses are also mentioned in 1āW\aśāsWraa treatise on drama in
    the section on 32 Angaragas (170239).
 3. The suggestion is that copper becomes hot Tuickly.
 4. The verse suggests the redness of dawn and twilight.
 5. Ranna brings events of his time into the story.
 6. The pun is on the meaning of his name, Duryuddha, one who cannot
    be conTuered.
 7. The moving wheel is a captivating motif, from the Ashoka cKakra to
    everyday Kannada as well. For example, the phrase cKakra WirXJisWa
    iddaQe (he is spinning his wheel) means causing something to happen.
 8. The thunderbolt is the nail in his chariot, and the lightning Àashes are
    sparks from the moving chariot.
 9. The description of thighs as banana stems is usually used to describe
    women.
10. As a cultural practice, the use of the left is considered improper.
11. In the 0aKaEKaraWa, Baladeva rebukes Bhima soundly, Baladeva and
    Vasudeva are closely associated revered figures for the Jains.
12. Aruna, son of Vinata born as an egg. The egg was broken by his mother,
    and he was born with deformed thighs and became the charioteer of
    the Sun.
13. Bhima is in angry, raXdra mood and she is arousing love in him. Smara
    had no body, Krishne gave saQMīYaQi and brought him to life. Bhima
    and Satyashraya are brought together in the Chalukya Kandarpa.
14. The box here is a religiously significant kara‫ڲ‬i in which the OiQJa is
    placed.
15. The verse is reminiscent of a \aQWra that seeks to compel action.
16. The suggestion is that Manmatha and his five arrows are unnecessary
    because of her fivefold beauty.
17. Kama, here Angodbhava is said to take birth in a person, hence inÀaming
    them with love.
18. This verse is reminiscent of the customary ā\XdKaSūMa during Navaratri
    when weapons are worshipped.


Canto Nine
 1. Satyanilaya is a play on his patron’s name, Satyashraya, where aśra\a
    like QiOa\a means dwelling.
 2. Ashwatthama bears Shiva’s features since he is said to be his incarnation.
 3. The verse is composed in Prithvi metre.
 4. Rajoguna among the three dispositions refers to the Tuality of passion.
316                   NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION

 5. Probably refers to Dhanvantari, the god of medicine.
 6. ƖSōśaQa is a ritual gesture of drinking water in the palm with the thumb
    placed between pointer and middle finger.
 7. The verse refers to the South Indian calendar. The 15th of the month
    is SaXr۬aPi of the ascending fortnight. The following fortnight ends
    on aPāYās\a. $PāYās\a is an inauspicious day for people in Karnataka
    and Andhra Pradesh though considered auspicious by Tamilians. The
    difference in calendars between the north and south is apparent in the
    śXddKadiQaP which begins from the first day of the ascending moon
    for South Indians. For North Indians, śXddKa begins from SaXrQaPi or
    the descending Moon.


Canto Ten
 1. .iQQaras are celestial guards with bodies of men with heads of horses.
    .iQQara here could also be a pun in Sanskrit kiPQara? (Is it a battle
    between human beings?).
 2. Bhairava is a destructive form of Shiva.
 3. Java refers to Yama.
 4. Refers to Indra who is lord of the gods.
 5. The sēWX is considered the boundary in the south.
