RANNA Gadāyuddham 

The Gadāyuddham (The Duel of the Maces) is a kāvya composed in classical Kannada literary style at the turn of the eleventh century CE. It is written in campū, a genre that developed in the tenth century as a mixture of poetry and prose. Ranna's poem is remarkably dramatic in nature and is a meditation on the cost of war. Crisp dialogue, body gestures and imagery fill the poem. It is as if the poet were giving us directions for a play. 

Ranna employs 'flashbacks', a technique called simhāvalūkana, that is, a lion turning casually to glance behind him. Ranna builds up to the duel through characters recalling episodes of injury or through lamentation. The duel occupies only a short space in the eighth canto, but Ranna takes this time to fill in past episodes and reflect on the impact of war. This thousand-year-old poem will interest scholars as well as lay readers.

A Note from the Kannada Language Chair 

Instituted in November 2015 by the Department of Kannada and Culture, Government of Karnataka, Kannada Language Chair of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi is dedicated to promote excellence in teaching, researching and publishing on language, literature and culture of Karnataka in all its multilingual and plural manifestations. The Chair encourages comparative studies across a wide range of domains and also aims at dis seminating knowledge of Kannada language, literature and culture both at national and international levels. 

The Chair has taken up translation projects with the objective of rendering into English a whole gamut of classical and non classical Kannada texts of seminal nature. This process has been initiated with the translation of three major texts of tenth century Kavirājamārgam of Srīvijaya, Vaddārādhane of Sivakõțyācārya and Gadāyuddham of Ranna. 

The current book Gadāyuddham is a celebrated classical Kannada text written by most powerful poet Ranna of tenth century. He is known as one of the three gems (ratnatraya) and also given the title 'the emperor of poets' (kavi cakravarti). Ranna retold Mahābhārata on the model of Ādi Kavi Pampa's Vikramārjuna Vijayam. 

Most of the critiques treat Gadāyuddham as a static text, so lidified in time and space. However, this popular text is not just a 'text', but expanded itself over the centuries to become a family of literary and performance traditions in Karnataka, yielding to the social imaginaries and the historical aspirations of artists, sculptors, musicians, and many others. Such multiple narratives should have been a part of understanding Gadāyuddham text.A NOTE FROM THE KANNADA LANGUAGE CHAIR 

There are hundreds of sculptural representations of Bhīma and Duryodhana fighting each other on the banks of Dvaipāyana lake, carved on the walls and pillars of temples in Karnataka. The fifteenth century poet, Kumāravyāsa once again recreated Gadāyuddham in Bhāmini Satpadi which helped the text to reach out vast audience through singing and also helped the performers of gamaka tradition to reach much wider audience. The medieval harikathā tradition also made Gadāyuddham a popular episode among common folk. During the early part of twentieth century, Gadāyuddham has been rewritten for yakşagāna performance which transformed the classical text into a living text for the benefit of contemporary audience. 

Thus Gadāyuddham has created a complex interrelationship between living texts, recitations and performances which needed to be discussed intensely by the scholars. 

Translating such classical texts into English is a challenge beleaguered with difficulties. Leading scholars of classical Kannada, R.V.S. Sundaram, Ammel Sharaon and Akkamahadevi have jointly accepted these challenges and made translation a possible. I thank all of them for their industriousness and com mitment. I consider this an auspicious beginning paving the way 

to more translations of the same text for years to come. 

The generous support of Kavi Cakravarti Ranna Pratishthana, Mudhol, Karnataka makes it possible for Kannada Language Chair to publish this book. I thank them for their support! 

I am thankful to Manohar Publishers & Distributers for taking this onerous task of publishing the daring translation of a monu mental Kannada work.

A Note on Transliteration 

Transliterating a regional text like Gadāyuddham requires special attention. It varies from transliterations of Sanskrit texts, which do not fit the case of Old Kannada and other Dravidian languages. Since Kannada has both long and short letters, ē and 7 are employed to differentiate them. 

There are special sounds and letters like !a (retroflex lateral sound different from 'la'), ra (trill different from the flap 'ra') and a peculiar sound, now pronounced as !a and found frequently in Old Kannada called 'rala'. These two are denoted as ra and la. 

The anusvāra which is governed by certain rules in Sanskrit is pronounced as 'm'. But the anusvāra replaces all nasals in Kannada, which confuses the reader who is unable to distinguish between the masculine singular ending ('n') and neuter singular ending (m). If the anusvāra is used for all the nasals, the singular 'n' (I) and plural 'ām' (we) would be written in the same way, adding to the confusion. Hence, we have retained the original pronunciation of the sounds. Nasals are represented by their respective symbols ('n' for velar, 'ñ for palatal, 'n' for retroflex and 'n' for alveolar or dental nasal) while 'm' is used for both the labial nasal 'm' as well as the anusvāra which is also pro nounced as 'm'.

Introduction 

The Gadāyuddham (The Duel of the Maces) is a kāvya, composed in classical Kannada literary style at the turn of the eleventh century CE. Based on a single episode in the Salya Parva, the ninth book of the Mahabharata depicting the decisive battle between the cousins, Bhima and Duryodhana, the Gadāyuddham brings the great battle to an end. The poem bears another title, the Sāhasabhīmavijayam (The Victory of Daring Bhima). 

However, we have chosen to call it by its popular name, Gadāyuddham, which is also the name its poet Ranna uses when introducing his work in verses 1.32, 33 and 34. Further, the earlier printed editions also carried this title. The literary critic, T.N. Srikantaiah published an abridged version in 1949 called Gadāyuddha Sangraha. B.M. Srikantaiah called his adaptation for the stage, Gadāyuddha Nāțaka. Sāhasabhīmavijayam, on the other hand, is the attributed title because it appears in the colophon at the end of each āśvāsa or canto that summarizes its respective theme. Since Pampa (902-75 CE), considered the ādikavi or first poet of Kannada literature dedicated his work, Vikramārjunavijayam, to his patron Arikesari II, it is believed that the Sālsabhīmavijayam is patterned along the same lines. Yet Ranna portrays Duryodhana, the anti-hero as a heroic kshatriya, a loyal friend and a loving brother. Hence, the title Gadāyuddha recognizes not one, but two 

formidable opponents and heroes. 

Ranna identifies Bhima with his patron, the Western Chalukyan king, Irivabedanga Satyashraya who ruled between 997 and 1008 CE. In the second canto, he provides a brief genealogy (vamśāvaļi). Here we observe an attempt to link the Western Chalukyas of Kalyana with the earlier Chalukyas of Badami to further an imperial vision that connects the Kalyana rulers to ancestors in

INTRODUCTION 

Ayodhya (Narasimhachar 1911; Pollock 2006, p. 155). This link would soon be standardized in inscriptions and serves as a reminder that historical records or textualized history are not to be taken at face value but provide an insight into the changing nature of self-representation and a concern for shaping public memory. 

Ranna was born in Muduvolal (now Mudhol) in present day Bagalkot district in 949 CE to a Jain family of bangle-sellers. Having studied Sanskrit, Prakrit and Kannada, he was patronized by a Ganga minister, Chavundaraya, and later appointed to the court of Ahavamalla Tailapa II (973-97 CE) where he earned the title kavi cakravarti (poet-emperor). He continued in the court of Tailapa's son, Irivabedanga Satyashraya (997-1009 CE) to whom he dedicates this work. Remarkably self-assured, Ranna pours scorn on pretend-poets and challenges readers to evaluate his work. Other works attributed to him are the Paraśurāma caritam, Cakrēšvara caritam, Ajitapurāņam as well as a lexicon, Ranna kanda. T.N. Srikantaiah speculates that the Cakreśvara Carite, a lost work by Ranna may have been dedicated to Tailapa II. The Ajitapurāņam composed in 993 ce, is based on Ajitanatha, the second Tirthankara. 

How might we understand the relationship between the Sanskrit epic and regional retellings of the Mahabharata? Are the early Kannada retellings a part of the Indo-European tradition of the hero? Are they discontinuities that disturb the imagined community of the primary epic, reshaping it towards 'new political ends'? (Hiltebeitel 2011, pp. 42-3). The period between the ninth and thirteenth centuries in the Kannada land was infused with the sentiment of vīra or heroism (Settar and Kalaburgi 1982). It is evident in literary compositions of the period as well as the density and spread of hero stone memorials that recorded warrior bravery and promised soldiers a place in heaven. Cynthia Talbot remarks that as the paradigmatic epic of war, the Mahabharata was usually the first Sanskrit epic to be adapted in regional literatures (Talbot 2016, p. 138). This is because, as Sheldon Pollock has presciently

noted, the epic had geo-political significance and courts endea voured to produce its idea of the world within their region. 

Pampa, Ponna and Ranna, considered the three gems of classical Kannada literature, belonged to the Jain religion. The poem's religious intent is rather different from religion as we understand it today. The poem stretches over vast regions: the earth, vanquished rulers and their kingdoms, and speaking in the same breath of the heavens and the underworld. We meet gods, varieties of spirits and divine creatures like celestial apsara maidens. The Jaina poets had to contend with a Vaidika Mahabharata which extolled violence through its heroic characters. Indeed, as Hiltebeitel's studies show, the central problem of the Mahabharata appears to be reconciling inevitable violence with the means to bring about the cessation of violence. Yet the Sramana Jains would find such an ideology difficult to digest. Pampa and Ranna give little place to Krishna in their works. Though Ranna begins his cantos with invocations to Vaishnava deities, his treatment of Krishna is as a king and advisor, eschewing the strong bhakti theme of the Sanskrit epic. Through Duryodhana, Krishna is frequently criticized for his unethical decisions. Nevertheless, the Chalukya crest was the boar (Varahalāñchana), significant because of the oft-repeated invocation, 'where the whole earth is said to be sustained with ease by Vishnu incarnate as the Boar' (Ramesh 1983). Ranna appears to negotiate his presence in the court by composing separate works, the Jaina Ajitapurāņam and the worldly (laukika) Gadāyuddham. Ranna employs poetics as a critique of violence, for the heroic rasa (vīra) of the two warriors is overshadowed in the poem by bhībhatsa and raudra sentiments - rage and disgust. 

The poetic style of a regional kāvya like the Gadāyuddham was shaped by the second millennium assertion of 'vernacular languages. Across the subcontinent, Pollock says, Sanskrit lost its eminent place as regional languages came to the fore. The earliest treatise of poetics in Kannada is the ninth century Kavirājamārgam (KRM). Though it addresses topics of grammar, 

xvi 

INTRODUCTION 

prosody and lexicon, the KRM endeavours to locate itself in a particular geographic and cultural setting, an effort distinct from the 'cosmopolitan' literary cultures of Sanskrit and Prakrit (Srivijaya 2017). Ranna says that Kannada is spoken over two lands, and the Kannada spoken in Puligere is the true Kannada (1.42). The Epigraphia Indica records a 930 CE inscription that says, 'In the circle of the land of Bharata is a perfect ornament, the region of Kuntaļa, and a very gem in this realm is the people place of Purikara [Puligere), the Two Six-Hundred sadministrative unit]' (EI 13: 311, lines 24-5). It helps to remember that the relationship between language, land and people has changed over time. If early Kannada literature is characterized by a relationship between language and land, the modern history of South India has seen this relationship recast as one between language and people, becoming a veritable identity (Mitchell 2009). 

The KRM distinguishes a dēsi Kannada literary style from the dominant Sanskrit mārga style. Dēsi style is marked by a local ‘naturalness' without the arduous complex forms employed in Sanskrit literature. Like other poets, Ranna is an ubhayakavi, well versed in both Kannada and Sanskrit. The Gadāyuddham is written in campū, a genre that arose in the tenth century as a mixture of poetry and prose. It is only alluded to in the KRM which terms it a gadya-katha (prose narrative). With its long prose sections, it is a genre well-suited to reading, and unlike purely metrical poems, it cannot be sung. 

While the Kannada poets were aware of Sanskrit dramas, no extant drama has been found in early Kannada literature. The first prose work in Kannada, the Vaddarādane mentions local dramatic forms for amusement (prakaraṇa) though there is limited evidence. Yet, Ranna's poem is remarkably dramatic in nature. Crisp dia logue, body gestures and imagery fill the poem. It is as if the poet were giving us directions for a play. Little wonder then that the poem was adapted for the stage by well-known writer, B.M. Srikantiah in the twentieth century as Gadāyuddha Nāțakam. In an unusual section, the reader will find nine verses on aestheticized

sentiment (rasa) – erotic, heroic, macabre, humorous, ferocity, fear, compassion, wonder and tranquillity - as they unfold on the battlefield. It recalls the Nātyaśāstra, the foundational dramaturgical treatise in Sanskrit that puts forward a theory of rasa. Following convention, Ranna refers to the compositions and poets who have influenced him: Valmiki, Vyasa, Kalidasa and Bana - Sanskrit poets. Those who go unmentioned are Bhatta-Narayana and Bhasa whose Sanskrit plays, Vēņī- samhāram and Urubhangam are based Bhima's on avenging of Draupadi's humiliation. 

Though Ranna was a court poet and the composition restricted to an elite audience, it is likely that the audience was introduced to it in both, manuscript form and oral form. The arrangement of the poem in cantos, and the long, robust tradition of manuscript production implies that the poem was recorded in writing, but the oral and aural history of texts in India suggest that this poem was recited in the gamaka tradition to its audience. Gamaka is a form of storytelling that continues to be popular in Karnataka. The recitation is based on the meter of the poem but punctuated to convey the meaning of the verse. The gamaki may divide compound words so that the audience is able to understand and appreciate the poem better. Music is a frequent accompaniment and the gamaki also attends to the emotion conveyed in the verse. Interested readers of pre-modern Kannada literature still come together to listen to these recitations that today have also been recorded. Among the most popular of gamaka performances is Kumaravyasa's fifteenth century work, Karnāța Kathā Manjari (the Karnataka Mahabharata), an adaptation of the first ten parvas of the epic. 

Attending to the poem's dramatic nature is a way to broaden our treatment of pre-modern compositions. Recent studies have highlighted the performative nature of compositions. The Gadā yuddham is no exception. The brevity of the Kanda meter and directness of its dialogue is unusual in poems of its time that are characterized by ornamentation and long meters. Draupadi enters bearing pots on her head in the manner of the Karaga, a 

xviii 

INTRODUCTION 

folk ritual dedicated to Draupadi as Goddess in South India, which heightens the dramatic atmosphere. The Gadāyuddham with its intense and physically imposing characters is frequently a subject of the Yakshagana, a signature theatrical form from coastal Karnataka which is seen on the jacket of this book. Elaborate costume and make-up, music, dance and robust dialogue delivery characterize this art. 

The poem contains 578 verses, too many to dwell on for one brief episode. Indeed, the duel between Bhima and Duryodhana appears only in the eighth canto. Instead, Ranna employs 'flashbacks’, a technique called simhāvalūkana, that is, a lion turning casually to glance behind him. Ranna builds up to the duel through characters recalling episodes of injury or through lamentation as Duryodhana walks through the blood-soaked battlefield, pausing to reflect on his losses as he comes upon slain family and friends. We see a broken, defiant man recall his loyalties, friendships and frustration in the company of his advisor, Sanjaya. The poem is dedicated to Bhima, but the reader is struck by Ranna's elevated treatment of his pratināyaka, the anti-hero, Duryodhana. 

What does the Gadāyuddham offer readers today? This text certainly benefits from a revival of interest in translations of pre modern Indian literature. The Mahabharata confesses to cover the entire expanse of human experience and has been the subject of many new retellings as the Indian publishing industry has burgeoned. Ranna's thousand-year-old poem is a text of historical and literary interest, but readers will also find in it a meditation on the cost of war. We are mistaken, it reminds us, if we think history is written by winners. In a startling section, the battlefield strewn with swollen bodies, is visited by many gangs of spirits (flesh eating pishachis and mad marulus) who come hungry and desiring to profit by selling off soldier's bodies. With Duryodhana, we witness the effects of war, and no reader will fail to be moved by his lamentations. Ranna is sometimes dismissed as only a 'war-poet', but in our mediatized age where singular heroes are

fashioned through circulating images, Ranna presents us with a multi-faceted view of the battlefield where there are no winners, but men and women counting their losses. The reader will not fail to be struck by the irony of the title, The Victory of Daring Bhima for the tale is a cautionary one and one as relevant today, as Ranna thought it was in the tenth century. 

Texts 

The Institute of Kannada Studies (IKS), Mysore University holds a palm-leaf manuscript dating to 1348 CE. The institute also holds a paper manuscript copied by P. Subraya Bhat in 1946. He later published an edition with commentary called the Gadāyuddha Darpanam in 1975. The Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras also holds a palm-leaf manuscript which was copied by H. Chennakesava Ayyengar. The Gadāyuddham was serialized in 1895 in Karnataka Kāvyamañjari by S.G. Narasimhacharya and M.A. Ramanuja Ayyengar. Ayyengar published this work separately in 1919. The third edition by Ayyengar came out from Wesleyan Press, Mysore in 1925 and remains the standard edition on which prose translations in Kannada have been based. In 1949, poet and literary critic, T.N. Srikantaiah published Gadāyuddha Sangraham, an abridged version of the poem. We have consulted R.V. Kulkarni's Kavicakravarti Kavi Ranna Viracitam Sahasa Bhīmavijayam (1985) published by the Kannada Sahitya Parishat as well as B.S. Sannaiah and Ramegowda's Sāhasa Bhīmavijayam (1985) published by the University of Mysore. Where we have found variations in the Kannada text, we have consulted the IKS manuscripts and secondary sources. 

We are grateful to Dr. T.V. Venkatachala Sastry, the eminent scholar of Classical Kannada for guiding us at all stages of this translation. We thank G.G. Majunathan for giving us the paper manuscript copied by H. Chennakeshava Ayyangar from D. 2035, ORI, Madras. We express our warm thanks to Prof. Purushothama Bilimale, Kannada Language Chair at Jawaharlal Nehru University,XX

Blessed Satyashraya! His birth illuminated the fame of his father.

Like those not borne by infamy His pursuit is comparable to the old purushas. A life untarnished - The all-powerful emperor of truth. 

Born to Kamala, Gentle Beloved of the Entire World, Lover of Uma: Exalted by these qualities, he is the incarnation of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra. Illustrious slayer! 

Some approach in combat Some extend their hands in surrender. He does not hesitate, giving no mind if their number exceeds a crore. The Illustrious Slayer proceeds on his way! 

His cardinal elephant stomps to the fore against the famous Ghurjaras on their elephant army. The princes' elephants follow the leading elephant, People say, "Were you to lead, there will be followers' So the thread follows the needle, and princes follow Satyashraya's elephants. 12 

16 

It pleases him to give for he is not wanting, His dazzling fame is a festoon, his magnificence and generosity on display Sweetsmelling Ammana Gandhavarana stops the rut elephants in their tracks; Unaided, he subdues the enemy goliaths on a single elephant: Who is equal to this beautiful slayer?

The arrow pierces the enemy's body The eye cannot follow the shower of arrows/the bounty of gold. Who is equal to his heroism? Can his enemies and supplicants appreciate his fortune? 

The mind fixed on one thought: after his beloved brother's death, he vowed to see his enemy's head roll. To chase after him – lift him up - haul him back here he determined not to bathe till then. And so, rolling him over, he destroyed him. This Kuvarankarama, he is equal to Parushurama!13 

The sun is sharpest at midday but even in the morning, enemies feel the luminous will of the great warrior, the Illustrious Slayer! 

A bee on the lotus feet of Shiva: sharing the company of excellent women, valiant in war devoted to the welfare of others, the Illustrious Slayer embraces the innocent. 

Rightfully, he refrained from killing Aparaditya who fled in fear to an island in the ocean. For a man must not be killed if he embraces a linga,14 or enters water, if dressed as a woman or climbs an anthill.15 He is a man because he spared his life. Who is equal to him? The valiant and terrible king! 22

On one side lies the gleaming ocean, Satyashraya's oceanic army in fiery anger lies on the other. Aparaditya trembled in fear, like an insect caught between the ends of a dry, burning twig. 

The western sea retreated when the Agneyastra was released, An army of monkeys bound it with a bridge built with mountains, The king's boats inflicted a hundred wounds – the ocean was devastated three times: by Parashurama, Raghurama and Kuvarankarama! 

Rudra burnt three cities at the beginning of Kritayuga, 16 In the Tretayuga, Anjaneya set fire to the demon kingdom. In the Dvaparayuga, Arjuna set the Khandava forest ablaze. And in the fourth yuga, the Chalukya Sun burned Aparaditya's realm, the glittering capital of the Shantara line. 

I watched an eclipse that rose from Indra's realm? swallowing the entire realm of the western sun/Aparaditya. Satyashraya and his overshadowing arms!18

Ammana Gandhavarana, the sweet smelling elephant - how appropriate his name! Having scaled the hill forts of other cities, it butts and bends trees to drink their nectar, it gathers jewels in heaps, then off to the western coast - it bathes with a mixture of camphor and ash, the rut elephant plays! 

Furious, he struck 21 times like that Rama of old who hunted down Kshatriyas. Now Narendra elephants no longer attack these parts Aparaditya has gifted him 21 elephants Had he refused, Emperor Satyashraya's anger may have scorched 21 generations. 

Enemies prostrate at his feet, Don't you know? They are weak, seeking to serve. He kills – Illustrious Slayer! He is prepared to battle, prepared to stake his life. 

The radiant lamp lights another, its luminosity is not extinguished when shared It is as if all the world is aglow He continues to provide, undiminished. Irivabedanga, the Illustrious Slayer! 

Satyashrayadeva is the beloved Lord of the Earth, the protagonist of this story, compared to the son of the Wind in this Gadayuddha composed by the great poet Ranna.

This composition is the renowned Gadayuddha Composed about Sahasabhima Composed by the jewel among poets, Ranna How can it be described? 

Recognize the fierce animosity that prevailed since the beginning between Kunti's celebrated sons – particularly the strong Bhima – and Duryodhana, eldest among esteemed Gandhari's sons. At the end of this battle of dharma, he struck and killed him. That is why Bhima is the victor Best among victors. Taking this as his centrepiece Ranna has composed the Gadayuddha. 

Early on, he approached chieftains and he rose, he rose by grace of a mandala king on the path to prosperity when in the eternal reign of the emperor, he came to be the Poet Ranna. 

Fame is permanent: it extends across the oceans, past the cardinal elephants, crosses the old mountains. Can donors and their money stand the test of time? Where are those recipients? What of their wealth? Why be bewitched by this wizardry? Ranna is the mahout's hook for elephant-poets!20

Oh Patron, you delight in the service of scholars! This work pleases and fulfils rasa; Marga, the conventional way agrees with Desi,19 the native style. It is well known and beneficial. 

To ignore it or not take it seriously begs the question: Are they (readers) truly king or cheat, thief or bard? or enemy? A grandchild perhaps, or an intimate relative? 

Can the poorest in the army camp offer anything? He attains the highest greatness from the Emperor Tailappa when he receives the title: Kavi Chakravarti Ranna, Emperor among Poets.20 

Among the poets past, none was conversant in it The seal on the treasury belonging to the Goddess of Speech is broken now, With respect to the poetry of Saraswati, he is a gem among poets. 

Aesthetics, ideas, organization, harmony - That is the way of the poets. Here is a strong, new country style by the four-faced Brahma poet-jewel, Ranna. 

Great men understand this work When the minister of the emperor of the Ganga land examined its substance of exceptional compositions, he called him a priceless jewel.

He is magnificent in the city of the king And laid in gold is a precious stone – The arrangement is a delight. He is a remarkable jewel: the poet Ranna. 

Kannada is the language across six hundred villages in two Kannada lands. That Kannada is the essence, Sanskrit is sweet and delicate: The Poet Ranna is cultivated and renowned in both languages. 

Is it his delightful scholarship? His artful poetry? His conduct is a gem in a jewelled ornament It is in his delightful scholarship. In his artful poetry! His conduct is a gem in the ocean of precious gems!21

Someone boasts, 'I am an examiner of jewels. I examine the jewels22 of the thousand hooded lord of serpents! You tell me, does he possess the eight hearts required to examine Ranna's compositions? 

If you peer inside, you will see the complete story of the Bharata in the Gadayuddha. The poet Ranna makes it known by way of the lion's gaze.23

They say the best are among the ancients, there are no worthy poets now. Don't say that – Poets may pass but their works stand What is excellent? What can be faulted? See and test on the touchstone Poetry will speak for itself. May scholars examine the quality of poems, whether old or new.24 

He that seeks only excellence, or wicked men who twang bows looking for a fault: If you really must count merits and faults, who is to stop you? 

The wealthy are not generous, those clever in speech are not free from envy, were the generous to be wealthy, and the unenvious be clever in speech, poets would be blessed. 

A natural genius is rare; most have no strength for scholarship or sharpness. They cannot deliver. In their arrogance, the unread and inattentive believe they are blessed by Saraswati Proud like rocks, they write for money. Such is their intelligence! Such merit! 

Chieftain Keshi, considered to be the Lotus Born God refined this work. Is it any wonder that Ranna's composition is an ornament on Lady Fame?

The Wind at the time of dissolution will blow away the army of the Bearer of the Kuru Earth like cotton. He is a lion against the sweet smelling Kaurava elephants. His face red with Dushasana's blood, a thunderbolt against Duryodhana's mountain thighs who struck Duryodhana's jewel studded crown with his feet. I describe this battle-renowned Bhima, Rama's equal. 

52 

Rival elephants scatter to become guardians of the directions, Kings flee to become the lords of the cardinal points, Army maidens who are fit to be mistresses of the directions25 I strive to describe the audacious Bhima deserving of praise. 

He rained blows on Hidimba and Jatasura, tore Jarasandha asunder by his joints, vanquished Bakasura and Kichaka, wrecked the army elephants, for he possesses the strength of lions. 

Smeared with the dark blood of the wicked Dushasana who rose from the Kurus He is the flame at dissolution of the world. Etched in letters on a wide, immovable pillar is his vow to break the thighs and crown of Suyodhana. The slayer of Hidimba stands on the Kurukshetra, frightful and ogre-like at the time of dissolution.

Meanwhile, Kanchuki26 who by convention may go noticed or unnoticed, is accompanied by Buddhimati her intimate companion and Yajnaseni, daughter of Panchala, born of a fire sacrifice, and burning with the fire of intolerable humiliation approached the son of the Wind. Her eyes are red as though she were carrying a karaga27 into battle while tears stream incessantly from her eyes, that are like tender red leaves. She is a pillar of victory in his garden. 

No agreement came about even after Krishna, enemy of demons, made attempts. By your merit alone, Suyodhana remains pitifully in the enemy camp. If the Sindhu's son and Dhritarashtra agree to a truce, our king will return to them joyfully! I am in turmoil today, relieve my doubts, O Kauravantaka, Destroyer of the Kauravas! 

Has your fiery anger been cooled by the warm blood that oozed from the chest of that wretched Dushasana? Has your anger too reduced so quickly? 

If the son of Yama agrees to an accord – that is, a concourse with the enemy, your refuge will be a forest dwelling. As for me, born in the mouth of fire, I will turn to fire for sanctuary. 

As she appealed in such agony, the son of the Wind with a smile on his lotus-face, thinks to himself,30

The son of the Wind felt his anger rise against his brother, 

Have I, son of the Wind, and Partha forgotten ourselves? Was it right to look on as Draupadi was humiliated? Are our lives an offering to another? 

61 

Feeling his anger against his brother grow, 

Arjuna and I committed a sin that day, We thought only of humility, not of valour! We were deluded by our brother whose sincere words sound like syllables of a magic spell. 

Filled with remorse, He, the fiery flood over the Kuru clan, the man who would dissolve Suyodhana, looked at Panchali's face,

This is the first canto describing Bhimasena's oath, in the Victory of Sahasa Bhima, the Chalukyan Emperor that the Poet Ranna, Emperor among poets, taking refuge at the holy roots of Kalpavriksha which are the holy feet of Srimad Ahavamalla, has composed for Sri Satyashraya, glory of his clan, foremost among warriors, supreme lord, king of poets, ruler of the earth, the refuge of men, king of the world.

Canto Two 

Daring Bhima, powerful in arm is invincible against his brother-warriors who seek their inheritance, for his arm is the Mandara mountain that churns the ocean of force of the Kuru king to gain Shri, Goddess of Wealth. 

1 

In this manner he, the fire of Kaalal for the Kaurava clan, a Narasimha who played upon the wide chest of the demon-born Dushasana, a cyclonic wind at the final deluge that uprooted the pride of the strong tree-like brother of the Kuru king, the encircling roaring ocean of dissolution that drowned the enemy's mighty army, a majestic man supported by those terrible arms – on his mind weighed the vow to break the Kuru king's thick, straight thighs. He, the fiery comet tail against the Serpent Flag Bearer, he causes the Pandava strength to glow, wall of the Pandava fort, a lone hero who tore Jarasandha's joints apart, he: the tilaka of Satyashraya's line, illustrious slayer, he is Yama, god of death dominating the brave soldiers of the enemy camp, Chalukya Narayana, Chalukya Lion, the Chalukya Sun, of spotless character, the Ammana Gandhavarana, he, the symbol of audacity is Bhima sena who in mounting anger has fulfilled his vow. 

With his savage claws the lion cleaves the forehead of the rut elephant: Is it befitting to be called an Enemy of Deer? You, who dichotomized Jarasandha: Does it honour you to be called the Enemy of Kurus?

Oh Illustrious Slayer, Lord and Supreme One, Daring Bhima! Who could survive after causing you injury? Your terrible mace and iron bolt hack away like sheep being chopped up, Wounded corpses become food for ghosts in war. Don't your fallen enemies proclaim your heroism? 

So the daughter of Fire praised the son of the Wind, 

Both, the body and its ornaments come to ruin. Fame is the gold that escapes destruction Therefore, Oh Iridescent Slayer, give away your body and riches in exchange for everlasting wealth! 

Do jewels, gold, wealth and ornaments please wives? Like you, may husbands demonstrate their merit by wounding with weapons, Oh Illustrious Slayer!

When she taunted him in this manner, Buddhimati responded, 

He gives to those in need, he protects them who surrender in fear; Who but the Illustrious Slayer is as charitable and forgiving? Is there a crookedness in his expression, a stammer in his speech? 

If you think about it, speech is everything for these kings, not duty – I know them well and that is how it is. Listen, Oh Illustrious Slayer! Only kings like you fulfil the affairs of state.

Then the elderly Kanchuki spoke, “Among the ancestral kings was the king of Ayodhya, the supreme lord Satyashraya who was the refuge of such merits like truth, whose influence extends to the guardian elephants of the great directions, and who was also called Vishnuwardhana, Jayasimhadeva who felled the Rashtra kuta elephants and received growing love from his people, Ranasinghasimha who was attractive in battle and loved by his people, Pulakeshi, the supreme lord of Vatapi city, who performed the Ashwamedha sacrifice, and whose influence spread to the islands, Keertivarma, who protected the auspicious, became the king. His son was the second Satyashraya. His youngest son was Mangalarnava, the ocean of auspiciousness. Another Satyashraya was the second Satyavrati. His son was Adityavarma, and his son was Vikramaditya. His son was Durdharamalla and his son was Vijayaditya Bhattaraka, also known as Niravadya. His son Konkani Vikramaditya was also known as Vikramarnava. His younger son was Bhima Parakrama whose son was the second Keertivarma, and his son was the elder Tailappa. His son was Kundiya Bhima who killed Mukundi. His son, Vikramaditya had a son, Ahavamalla whose title was Raņarangamalla, great warrior. Ahavamalla married Bonkadevi who belonged to the Chaidya lineage. His son Vikramaditya was Uttungamalla, a great warrior. [Benediction] He is the refuge of the whole world, lord of the earth, great king of kings, supreme lord over kings, the venerable one. He wields terror over the king of Karahata, decked in ornaments that are his merits, having noble birthwinning over Jaadhilandhra, who mounted an elephant and won over Pallikota, destroyer of Bhadraka, a terror to the Konkan, terrifying to both armies, a lion against enemy dynasty. Terrifying in battle, he smashes the herd of enemy elephants. He is Kareendra, lion warrior. He is the Garuda to the enemy serpents, lion to the krakali elephant, a lion who attacks the forehead of the most excellent elephants, the sun of Yadava clan, terrible in the battle. He is a tiger among the deer. Demon in battle, Rama without blemish, vanquisher of armies,

He is the fire spreading through the Malava kings, who wards off the control of inauspicious planets, lord of numerous countries, he destroys the armies of rut elephants. He is Utpakyamalla, Nurmadi Tailappa,- Ahavamalladeva, of the Chalukya line.

With Bhimasena's permission, Vidushaka, his intimate and witty companion, said: Oy! Old Kanchuki! You, Panchali and Buddhimati appear like Daavara spirits carrying a karaga into a battle between gods and demons. You have recited your lineage and spoken well of your kings. Your eloquent speech is very nice! But where is Dhritarashtra? Where is Gangeya? Where is the treaty? Dushasana was killed first followed by a hundred Kauravas. Only one remains: Duryodhana. To kill and win over him is no big deal for our king. Do not worry about it." Having said this, he turned to look at Panchali,

She smiled and at Vidushaka's words and returned happily to her home when before she had come in tears. By this time, he, being also Shantanu's son, the son of Mandakini, was the last vasulo to descend on earth on account of Vashishta's curse. Being Jamadagni's disciple, he won over his son Parasurama. His flag bore golden cymbals and he was called Devavrati for had sworn an oath to the gods. He who would die by his own will, the grand sire of the Kuru clan, terrifying in battle, this Bhishma lies on a bed of arrows. 

From the Bharadvaja clan, the Pot-born One was principal instructor to both the Kauravas and Pandavas, an archery expert across the three worlds. He was Ashvatthama's father, who is Rudra's incarnation. He received all of Parasurama's weapons and was blessed by him. This Drona was killed, who was proficient in the art of the bow, his chariot guided by red horses, and whose flag bore a gold kalasha pot.

Can a warrior sharpen a wooden knife like a sword is sharpened? If you patronize a soldier, he will display his courage - What will a coward prove to his master in battle? 

If he shows no manliness when cattle are abducted or a woman laments, or when serving his master, in tensions among relations, or if a village is threatened, then he is no man - simply impotent. 

Hearing the king speak so harshly about Bhishma and the others, Sanjaya thought to himself, 

A primordial man, the eleventh Rudra, the three eyed one who loved the daughter of the Mountain Lord, he destroyed love with compassion, became Drona's son for a purpose - when the world speaks of Ashwatthama in this manner, How can Pingaksha, red-eyed and limited in strength scrutinize Virupaksha, the abnormal eyed one? 

He was rescued when the hostile Chitrangada25 carried him off into the sky - He has forgotten his relative's deed, in his vengeance. Will this Kaurava not enter Raurava hell? 

Oh yes! Shakuni is his accomplice in royal affairs, The charioteer's son is his valorous companion. Bhishma and the archery teacher's words sound bitter, of course but this is only an amusement of fate for the culprit with the serpent flag.

So Sanjaya looked at the Kuru king, 

Respected, bestowed with fitting and famous titles, He received his divine astra from Parashurama befitting a brave man 

The Pandavas and Kauravas saluted him with folded palms 

chery teacher fought against Gandivi:26 You have seen arrows rain down in showers! 

It is true and proper that he was born of divine Ganga, and received the king's grace, Understandably, his arms have developed an itch, well suited to the expert archer How proper for one with a name like 'Bhishma', 

The son of the Sindhu river demonstrated his heroism on the battlefield for all to see.

One was born from the river, the other born in a kalasha pot:27 they have touched the pinnacle of devotion. Yet, it is beyond their scope to win the war. Don't you understand Arjuna's daring capability? 

When hostile Chitrangada carried you off, Dharma's son entreated his younger brother who shot a ladder of arrows to carry you down from the sky, after Bhanumati's tearful plea. Who else could do it? Phalguna, the expert archer, shot a fish with his weapon at Krishna's svayamvara!28 

Oh King! Bhanumati was consoled when you were under siege. Gandivi released a fitting astra, immediately, you were released. When you were carried down from the sky, this Kripa, this son of the River, this son of Radha, this king of Madra, this Pot-born, 

these Kuru men, had they fallen faint? The virtuous and strong Pandava who went to fight with Antaka, returned with the life of the Brahmin's lost son, and offered the Khandava forest as food on Agni's request.29 

Partha, who sat Anjaneya on his flag, made Hari his charioteer and compelled Madana's 

enemy30 to offer his astra. He fulfilled his duties, 31 whose father is invoked by all.60

When the Rajasuya sacrifice was performed without delay, Vibhishana of Lanka sent his tributes. Mounds of gold offered by Kubera32 were given to Brahmins according to his father's wishes How can you denigrate Gandivi's heroism that you witnessed yourself, Suyodhana?33 

Arjuna, resolute warrior received the Pashupata astra from Mrida Half the throne from the Lord of the forever thirty years olds, From Narayana he received Subhadra. 34 

The warrior alone won over eleven akshohinis with one chariot Alone, Vijaya won over his enemies when the cows were abducted.35 

When Antaka, Indra, 

Vanquisher of Kama, son of Bhanu the Pot-born one or Shantanu's son could not win over the son of Kunti, could anyone else do so? 

How strong he is to break down the door of Lanka that the great Anjaneya settled on his flag! Could any hero counter Gandivi?

He entered the realm of the Serpent King. won against the snakes, and earned his daughter. On one wedding mat Partha sat with Jayalakshmi, Kirti and Ulupi. 36 

When the fire spread, when wild animals attacked, as serpents surrounded enemy lands, in forests and dark caves, in the company of enemies, sharing their bed with boars, elephants and donkeys: In those terrible places, did the man with the jackal belly whose arms are a diamond-hard cage, not serve as his brothers' protector?37

When battle weary Yakshas resisted his entrance at the Saugandhika pond, he packed them off to Yama-land and plucked a fragrant lotus. Our Hero, Terrible Man, Illustrious slayer!38

Saraswati withdraws from Brahma's mouth to sit in his mouth, and Lakshmi vacates the lotus pond to sit on his chest. The Illustrious Slayer is both Chaturanana and Krishna 39 

Baka, Hidimba, Kichaka Kimmira and Jatasura were killed by him. He slaughtered heroic Jarasandha too. Is the forceful son of the Wind an ordinary man?

Tailappa, lord of men, commanded elephants against the Ghurjaras. He won and the Konkan kings were made to send an extraordinary tribute. 

He assailed the ocean and extended his lands. Haven't we all heard - He goes by the name Daring Bhima. 

A lion against the strong Kalinga king who is an excellent rut elephant, hundred Kaurava heroes turned to powder in his iron rod arms. His belly fills with Dushasana warm spilt blood. Fiery against enemies, he cannot be conquered! Better than any other, the Chalukya Lion!

Canto Three 

His Majesty belongs to the lineage of the ambrosia-moon whose eternal rays extend across the celestial range. At his feet are the immortals. His tremendous shoulders break down elephants of the enemy kings. This is the dazzling fame of the Daring Bhima. 

Saying this, Sanjaya described the intrepid deeds of the Daring Bhima, 

Shakra's son, the renowned Bharata hero launched arrows and Bhima brought down the army of Kuru king with his terrible club: the fallen army, fallen horses, fallen elephants strewn over the Kurukshetra like crushed cumin seeds... As though Yama had vomited after his meal.? 

From the quiver, one arrow becomes ten when he prepared to shoot. When they leave the bowstring, hundred arrows fly one thousand break the enemies' arrows, in the soldiers' bodies they turn to a hundred thousand arrows. Too many to count! What praise for the power of Partha's bow?

Chariot horses move in one direction The chariots move in another! See them fallen and vanquished - 

The charioteer is laid out in another direction. Pritha's son is known for the blow of his mace. 

Archers lie strewn amongst scattered swords and spears locked together On closer look, they have been turned to a heap of bones by the Wind's son. 

Soldiers slain by soldiers, horses by horses, chariots by chariots - the Wind's son felled the enemy elephants and destroyed his enemies. 

Some he swallowed delicately Some Kauravas he assailed, captured and swallowed, Some he split down the front Some Maruti cooked for the Lord of Death.470

Some he chopped to bits, his arrows tore the joints apart of some, A few he sacrificed to the directions and some he ground on stone with his arms. 

Like shaking down a Banyan tree's fruit Like beating a mad dog Like pounding a monitor lizard Such a beating, did the son of the Wind give the crushed Kaurvas. 

Some he tossed up, pressed, caught and pounded with his mace. Some he punched, twisted and exacted pain, shaving them down with his weapon-arms. Some he pierced, hurled, battled and battered them with his bow. 

The Wind's son is a cruel elephant killing with gay abandon. 

Showing off, he hit - hit them loudly, rammed them with rocks and tree trunks, thumping forcefully, punching with both fists, crushing Baka's solid body, Proud of the strength in his arms, he glitters like an array of lightning bolts, the son of the Wind who killed his enemy Basaka, the elephant. 

Hurled across to different directions elephants become guardians of the directions. Aquatic elephants swim in the ocean, sky elephants fly like clouds... Is Bhima creating different creaturely forms?

As though Kritanta, the god of death were showing favour to his son, the son of Dharma put on a show of destruction with his powerful arms. 

Bhima grasped his mace and Gandivi took up his bow, the world has no heroes to take up weapons against them - Oh Kuru king, is their power new to you? 

As though Yama's anger were his own anger, As though Yama himself had minced the enemy into tiny, little bits having angered Yama – for Bhima is like Yama, could the good soldiers possibly remain alive? 

His father is Yamaraja, his mother is the daughter of King Bhoja, 

Vasudeva is his younger brother-in-law, his enraged brothers are Bhima, Arjuna and the renowned twins eager for the sport of battle, his archery teacher is the Pot-born One. For Dharma's son is no ordinary man.

Oh son in the Kuru Sky! If the twins – humble and endeavouring become angry, no heroes can match their prowess in battle, yet you speak so lowly of them. 

For the lac palace that was set ablaze, they asked for Kushasthala and Jayanta, Kalindi and Vrkasthala for the poisoned laddus, the Varanavata town for being cheated in court For these reasons, Pandu's sons asked for five villages in reconciliation. 

The River's son's shame knew no bounds. Drona's anger was excessive. The Kauravas laughed aloud arrogantly - overenthusiasm turned friends into foes. Pritha's sons Gandivi and Bhima readied their bows determined to fight. As kings watched, Krishne was undressed by your brother. 

As Sanjaya said this, the Bearer of the Serpent Flag exploded, 

Constant in truth, you say! A fondness for dharma, you say! What son of Dharma? Everyone calls him a compassionate man! Such talk turned to lies on that day when the Brahmin teacher was killed by false statement. Their lies grew excessively! Did the beloved son of Kunti not become a sinner?

It seems to me that the hero became a slave in the game of dice, with his elder and younger brothers, wearing rough jute cloth in the forest, Pritha's son requested Shiva for divine weapons and in some foolishness became an ascetic, in the Matsya land, he became a eunuch, related to Vasudeva through marriage, he became a dancer - such a deplorable birth! 

Son of Yama who once was king, once the son of the Wind, once daughter of Fire, once the twins, who hid in the Matsya king's court once Partha, stripped of his manhood, wearing bangles as Brihannale! Is it the curse of Rambha or his own sinful doing? It was a fitting position! 

When our Brahmin teacher engulfed in the fiery pain of separation from his son flung his weapons away – he was killed by Shakra's son. To murder a teacher - does it not cause the ruin of one's name? 

31 

They call Dharma's son the son of Dharma! for he does not say, It is improper on my part, instead he tells fat lies. As the cardinal elephant crushed him, and he fell – still we call Bhima by the name Bhima, a fierce man! The eunuch in Virata's house - Still we call him Partha! Call them such names - don't call them heroes!

In this way, Duryodhana disparaged Hara, Purandara, Kapiraja, the king of monkeys, Kanjodara, 17 but did not stop at that and readied for war. Sanjaya responded, 

The gods are against you. Enemy-kings are shown favourby the gods, but you have no friends. The enemy kings do not need help. You are their rival and your words are meaningless. 

45 

Sanjaya's words were harsh to Duryodhana ears, he said in disgust, 

Victory in battle is left to the gods Yet manly effort is left to us Now, I shall fight Yama's son and others alone My resolve will sparkle!

The Celestial River's son, the Pot-born One, Son of the Daymaker and others have died in war. People say Duryodhana cannot win over the Pandavas alone; he has spread his sari out18 

These two: the power of my arms and the power of my mace will ensure my victory, Sanjaya! Why do I need anyone else? 

Having torn the forehead of the rut elephant like a lion, I kill my adversarial kings in anger. Who would help such a man? 

48 

Karna and the others are gone. I have no more desire left. Why do I need help? Do pot-drumsl' require the support of cymbals, drums and other instruments? 

49 

Having said this, Duryodhana hoisted his mace - that was like Yama's sceptre - over his shoulders, and walked towards the Pandavas. Despite knowing the nature of the Serpent Flag Bearer's anger, Sanjaya protested again fearlessly, 

Oh Sun in the Kuru sky! Nara and Nara's son, 20 your guru and his son, 21 the renowned Bhurisrava22 and the son of the celestial river too - Aren't they Atirathas who can fight against innumerable soldiers?23

The son of the Anila, Dțishtadyumna, Antaka's son, the great Satyaki, son of Matsya, Shikhandi, Doesn't Vyasa hold that these six Maharathas can fight ten thousand soldiers? 

The son of Ina,24 Dushasana, Vrishasena, and Ghatotkacha and the praiseworthy Nakula and Sahadeva are Ardharatha warriors. Don't you know this, O king? 

Oh Kuru King! You and the king of Madra, Somadatta, Kripa, and Kritavarma along with Shakuni are six samaratha Warriors, aren't you? 

The son of the Wind is a maharatha and you, oh king, are a samaratha, that is why the son of the Wind is superior to you - it is wise to forget the entanglement. Come to an agreement! 

Hearing Sanjaya's words, Pingakshaas grew enraged and responded cruelly, 

Ah, so he is an atiratha! I, the strong one, am the samaratha, you say! Maruti's strength makes him a superior Maharatha, it seems! Why, does Maruti's chariot have bigger wheels?90

You praise the others and snub me Ey Sanjaya! Do you think you are another Archery expert, another son of the Sindhu? 

You do not know the power of maharatha or my own power! Calling me samartha is an insult - am I not known to you? Is there another hero like the bearer of the Serpent Flag? 

Is it proper to say human flesh is superior flesh? To say that flesh and fat are superior? To say sacrifice of flesh is a superior sacrifice? To call deep sleep eternal sleep? To say that deep breath is life breath? To call a thorny shrub a superior tree or to say that Bhima is a maharatha? Sanjaya felt afraid when the king spoke so harshly. 

However much he may be instructed, a king's true nature remains unchanged, as tall bamboo/great lineage is thick and tough on the outside yet hollow on the inside. 

He knew what they said, “Silence is capable of conveying meaning', so it seemed sensible to obey him for it is also said, 'Do not provoke the honourable!' Sanjaya remained silent as the bearer of the Serpent Flag prepared for battle. He watched him walk toward the battlefield but Sanjaya, who was by nature a strong-willed fool desiring the welfare of his lord, could not standby in silence,

Ashvatthama and Balarama and the other two are part of the army, yet you believe you can fight the Pandavas without their expertise with only the strength of your arms! 59 

To Duryodhana, Sanjaya suggested that not only Baladeva and Ashvatthama, but Kripa and Kritavarman also remain. Honour the four heroes; make them army chiefs and triumph against your enemies, he said, 

It was impossible for the son of Celestial River Impossible for One Born in a Mud Pot Impossible for the son of Ina Do you think Drona's son is capable enough? 

Drona did us a lot of good! Has Drona's son been good for us? Have we any hope for him in the war - Why bother if the bitter bottle gourd is ripe or tender? 

The Plough Bearer was enthusiastic about battle and I placed my belief in him but he too left on pilgrimage

Fall at their lotus feet, relieve their mind's pain when you go to the camp. 

I'd go along with the prince and the Anga king to the elders in the mornings with happy tidings of war. Today, I am ashamed to go without them. 

The royal parasol for the Earth-Bearer is absent; the Drona tree on the Kanaka mountain is absent; lions are absent in the caves, the elephant herd is absent in the directions; how pitiable that the Wind's beloved Bhima has plundered the army with his long arms? How can I enter the renowned assembly again?

Leader of eleven Kaurava battalions! You are the consecrated king surrounded by the three royal parasols:28 We cannot comprehend this state you are in now, dear child! 

74 

Hearing their lamentations, Sanjaya realized that the elders had come. He informed Duryodhana with folded palms, 'Lord, your mother and father have come searching for you.' Like a lofty mountain peak struck by Indra's vajra weapon, Duryodhana bowed his head in shame. 

Obstructing enemy kings, in the enthusiasm of victory and three-fold celebrations29 with my brothers, sons and associates come in joy I thought I could see it – but it has turned out like this: Oh Fate! You have caused me to see my elders mourn in sorrow with tears rolling down their face, falling on their body.

The elders' tears turned to sprinkling water and their deep breath became a fan that awoke the jewel crest of the Kuru clan from his faint.33 

He awoke from his faint and saw his parents, overcome by shame he bowed his head. Then Sanjaya said to Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, “This is your son, the King of Kings, the mango tree at the centre of the Kuru land who greets you.'

And so the blind king requested the Kuru king,

Abandon your war effort, my son. Go back to your tent. Our dead boys are far gone. It is enough if you remain. Can we bring the dead back? 

As she spoke, Gandhari thought of her departed sons and her grief returned but Sanjaya reprimanded her for expressing her sorrow,

This Gandhari, mother of a Hundred Heroes – Today they call her mother of a Hundred Sorrows. Under the weight of her great sadness, she is marked out for weariness, O Kuru Lord!! 

The Ruler of the Earth saw the annihilation your brothers. Sorrowful, the son of Dharma desires a truce. Have you not understood the worthy oath he has sworn? 

They remain together by good fortune If one among the four brothers were to die in battle, would it be a victory for the son of Yama who is devoted to dharma? He would not survive. 

Sanjaya agreed with the king, 

This reasoning is quite proper. Oh King! Grasp what your father is saying. Hearing him, the King of the Earth said: 

The objections that you make are the basis of my principles! 

If a single brother were to die, among the renowned four, the son of Yama would offer his life's breath to Agni. Of my renowned brothers, not one among the hundred remains! Must I remain alone? I have thrown away

I will succeed against Phalguna! I will succeed against the Wind's son! Ha, Karna! Dushasana! I will yank you out from their stomach and having succeeded, I will live with Yama's son!

King Pandu and you ruled the earth together, but I cheated and snatched the five villages from their grasp! Will this Kuru king resume relations with them? 

I am your son and Dharmaja is your son too, isn't he? In that case: don't ruin your bond, patch things up. Live as you did before – in happiness. I, however, refuse your instruction. 

Leave me alone! He fell at his feet as he turned to face him. Sobbing profusely the blind king hugged his son and stammering, addressed that king. 

13 

In any case, you will not accept my advice. You have chosen enmity and you will fight with Pandu's sons. If you do not accept a truce, do us this kindness at least: Do as you will, but consult your grandfather. Please go and meet him, he said. 

'It will be my fortune!', he replied. Taking his parents' leave, he bid them to return home. His grief kept his feelings of anger and war at bay for a while. He walked through the battlefield in the company of Sanjaya and his mace,

Weapons, broken and soaked in blood, strewn under every step, pierced the soles of his feet. The Kuru king found no place for his foot. Stepping on swollen corpses, he walked on. 

14 

Then they saw him, 

Assemblies of flesh eating spirits had arrived, searching deliriously for thick corpses, while wounded soldiers stood guard over their chief's body, refusing to let spirits to approach. 

Are you the son of the blind king or simply blind since birth? Leave without taking another step! Duryodhana stepped to the side when soldiers minding their chief reprimanded him in blind anger. 

16 

A plough, wheel and mahout's hook adorn his sole. The plough, wheel and hook left recurring prints as the limping son of the Kuru clan walked slowly by. 

Looking at his state, tears rolled down Sanjaya's face and his throat felt hoarse with grief, 

The crowns of renowned enemy chiefs bow to your radiant foot stool on which rest your soft feet that are like golden lotuses. Isn't it fate's doing that you are made to walk on battleground pierced by javelins, arrows, swords, and spades?

Duryodhana, whose self-respect was his wealth, consoled Sanjaya who was shedding copious tears.? 

Separation from my sons and brothers is a mental affliction but it gives me no pain. Can wounds on my feet hurt? What pain can this battlefield cause when my mind is hard as a diamond? 

19 

The Pillar of the Kuru clan walked on, firm in his purpose. 

The Bearer of Serpent Flag is the abode of courage. As he walked slowly, he gazed at celestial women come searching for a fallen hero who faced off on the battlefield, a braveheart who died facing an elephant, a champ who died killing a thousand soldiers.8 

20 

Celestial magician-maidens perform Feats like Vidyadharas – leaping through the sky carrying fallen warriors whose bodies have fused with weapons of thirty-two varieties. 

Blood smeared across like fresh kumkum, lances were ornaments piercing earlobes, a streak of wounds made by nail marks gleamed like gems, brains spilled like a crown of flowers, as beloved apsaras carried away lifeless heroes, handsome with their sharp moustache. 10 

Observing this as he passed,

The king of the Kurus observed these youthful women, the corner of their eyes sparkling with amorous love mounting warrior-heroes on their laps before carrying them away.11 

Sanjaya understood what was on the king's mind, 

Heroism is incited when enthusiasm 12 is unabated and resolve not forsaken. Spirited warriors would not leave their positions, and warriors died because they would not retreat. 

Hair in disarray, a slack mouth, a slightly bent neck, eyes shut, the body washed in blood – Dead warriors perform a macabre rasa.13 

An enemy's arrow with twin heads struck the man beside him – spurts of blood and he under the illusion that he was wounded too, also fell faint making the other soldiers laugh.14 

We recognize the rasa of furiousness as a warrior on his horse induced fear with eyes wide open hand readied to strike, sword drawn biting down on his lip, his eyebrows knitted together. 

Biting on their finger, they ran to mount anthills, hurling their weapons away and making obeisance these timid soldiers trembled in the fever of terror mirroring the rasa of fear.

Furious soldiers refrained from killing those who stood with their faces turned away, hopeless and without pride bereft of their weapons with fearful, pitiable faces They showed compassion and did not kill them.15 

Behold how the rasa of wonder is created on the battlefield, as the soldier, strong in the arm, wields the sword that breaks in two - one blow to the horses, two blows to the elephants in rut! 

Pained by strenuous battle, unable to reach for their weapons, the rasa of tranquillity settled in them as their mind attended to the remembrance of the feet of their favourite god. 16 

Sanjaya walked along, showing the king the nine rasas in recreated form, 

The battlefield became a dark, frightening day as fiery swords flash like lightning born from rumbling clouds arrows rain as the great warriors/Indra roared. 

Fearsome arrows of adept archers fell in the battlefield like snipped tender shoots. So too how can the fall of those who stray from the dharmic path/string of the good bow be any great wonder?120

Swarmed by arrows/bees, and mounted Anjaneya/monkeys, as if a throng of chariots/host of birds So proceeded Gandivi's chariot, frightening enemies like a new fangled tree created by Yama.17 

Adorned with bells, Bhagadatta's elephant resembled the sky a delightful constellation of stars/a pearl necklace and a beautiful comet/flag. 

He embraced the long tusk of the enemy's elephant, embracing the long breasts of celestial damsels at the same time. Is anything impossible for the heroic soldier on the battlefield? 

The collision of elephants gave rise to [blazing] flames, warriors' arrows became fiery barriers and the flaming discus appeared to be the Sun's ring, enemy of darkness. 

37 

As he spoke in this manner, brains and guts of terrifying elephants spilt, their heads and wombs pierced repeatedly by arrows shot from right hands and left. Blood gushed from bodies like the Saraswati, flowing in a thousand directions. Enemies in their thousands faced off, fighting with fierce clubs and smashed crowns whose gems fell like lights and formed a rainbow. The battle waged between crores on the two sides, their weapons struck and the directions dazzled with flying sparks. Army elephants, horses, charioteers in the army lost their heads; their bodies danced on the field, while hungry pishachas, vetals and bhutas roamed with wide eyes, clapping gleefully as they watched them dance.

Let us eat this a little at a time; it will finish if eaten all at once, they said, unable to eat the elephant's corpse by themselves. Greedy mad spirits with starving minds 

refused to share with others.

Since there was an abundance of corpses, merchant-pishachas had arrived from a far desiring profit, who were selling the flesh of corpses to a group of pishachas.18

Brahmin rakshasas proclaimed a new veda – their clothes turned red with fresh blood, their sacred thread was glimmering fresh intestine as they instructed the gathering of pishachas on consuming flesh.

43 

Listening to the pishachi as they walked, 

His feet slipped on the ground, muddy with brain-splatter. 

Sanjaya steadied the Lord of the Earth, saying: At least your thighs aren't broken! No, said Duryodhana. But a lowly mad pishachi intervened, How will you stay alive, Oh Kaurava Lord? Won't Bhima break your thighs out of anger?20 

The words of the mad ones were harsh to his ears. He felt shattered recalling Maitreya's curse, that his thighs would be broken. He was extremely strong, so he set the thought aside. 'Is there any meaning in the words of a mad spirit?', he thought dismissively and carried on,

You had a palace of lac built out of jealousy for your relatives, and poisoned laddus made to kill. You have led Bhima to this state. Is the band of bhutas roaming this warfield mad, or are you the mad one? Let us compare the two, Oh Serpent Flag Bearer! 

45 

Suyodhana did not give him full hear, “The words of the mad ones are meaningless', he thought as he walked a short distance slowly. 

Eh! I swear on Long Haired Dhurjati! I will not allow you to pass without speaking! I swear on the warrior Bhima, if you cross that limit! When the pishachi swore on Dhurjati, he stopped. When it took Bhima's name, the king grew angry wanting to chase and beat it up with his club. The bhutas also took up cudgels. Sanjaya reasoned with the Serpent Flag Bearer and pacified him. 

46 

They walked across rough parts. Sanjaya showed him, 

“This is where Dushasana who wronged Draupadi was killed by Bhima.' 'I cannot hear of such a shameful act', he replied. Disturbed, he bowed his head as tears fell and asked, 'Where is the Master Archer? Where is Bhishma? I want to see them. Show me.'

They ascended tall mounds of elephants, crossed rivers of blood, got entangled in elephant trunks which were like bands of creepers in the dark forest cluster but they didn't mind and reached the spot. Drona's armour lay crushed by arrows. The Lord of the Kurus leaned on Sanjaya's shoulders for support. 

The union of lightness and heaviness seemed to Duryodhana like prosody as featherlight arrows swiftly pierced his Guru's body.21

The King of Kings saw Drona's dishevelled hair torn by wicked Dhrishtadhyumna's hand, 

Are we not aware of your skill with the bow? Not only Gandivi, even the wielder of the Pinakapani bow22 is no match for you. I simply don't know, Kumbhasambhava. Was it your indifference, or my fate that such a meaningless death befell you?

The King of Kings recalled Drona's son with anguish, 

Where was your Pinaka bow when mighty Partha shot his arrows and killed him? Where were your arrows when Drupada's son, Jatabala23 rolled his body in the dust and mercilessly severed his head? What became of that fiery eye on your forehead? O, son of my Guru! Where has the brimming love for your father gone? 51130

52 

He praised his teacher while chiding his teacher's son, 

He did not think, I will not bow before this Guru who ignored me and continued to fight, Instead, the man with the mark of the snake prostrated at his feet. Does an elder's legacy diminish over time? 

Clockwise, he circumambulated the Pot-born One three times. He saw as he walked from the other side, crushed by an overwhelming jumble of arrows, 

The Kuru king saw young Abhimanyu, a war hero. His blossom face with eyes half closed His severed hands looked demonic biting angrily on his lower lip. His body crumpled under the onslaught of arrows. The fallen one covered in an ocean of blood.

The Serpent Flag Bearer saw him in this condition,

You are unmatched in strength. No one is as brave. I pray to you, Abhimanyu, May I be a fraction as heroic in death! 

He thought to himself, 

Many heroes bear the weight 

of their fight on the war field. When that young Abhimanyu entered, he shouldered the burden of others, did he not become a delight among heroes? 

He made no distinction between tender boys, youths, the aged or the proficient, the audacious lion killed them all! Was he so tender? The Celestial River's son believed himself to be a young man too – how can he be a grand old man?26 

59 

He showered praise on the brave young Abhimanyu, 

A man who feeds the hungry, who does not retreat, nor deceive. Who is pure in mind, never crossing dharma's limits, and who is noble. We respect these four kinds. Among the honourable four, he deserves our respect. The Lord of the Kauravas paid his respects with folded palms to Abhimanyu.

Where is this beautiful Vrshasena28 who with his powerful arms cracked the hostile rut elephant's head so fearlessly? who lacerated his opponent's arrows, who was no different from my own son. 

64 

Looking around as he drew nearer, the king saw Shalya burnt by the angry fire of Dharma's son. Bhagadatta, felled by the Vijaya's arrows. Jayadratha, laid on a bed of arrows from Gandivi's furious bow. Shakuni slain by Sahadeva's terrible sword. The five sons of the serpant-like Shatabindu who was impaled like a mongoose by Nakula's javelin.29 They were dead: The Nivatakavacha, talataluka and paulomas, demons of great strength, nobles and kings of Kamarupa country, sixty thousand crore atirathas, another eighteen crore samarathas, Susharma and Trigarta who were called Samshaptaka, Bakasura's grandson, Jatasura's children Halayuddha, the terrible rakshasas, Pestle Bearers, Kala and Nila. He saw Saubala, Brhadbala, Vinda and Anu-Vinda. He saw Shankayuddhas who were the able kings of Kambhoja Sudakshina. He was stricken with grief seeing them lie there. 

These meritorious men are the jewel crests of the three worlds, great warriors, equal to the Kailasa mountain. Have these children of kings, assembled to fight, perished because of me?

Sanjaya consoled him as he repented,

If I were to speak of prudent conduct, I'd say come to an agreement. Don't fight Kunti's children. War is the abode of uncountable faults. It is the place of catastrophe for Kshatriyas. Esteemed men were unable to convince you reality. This roaring lion among the Chalukyas, Bhima, slayer of Hidimba will not remain without killing you like Yama at the time of Dissolution. 

66 

Here ends the description of Duryodhana's lament in the fourth canto of the Victory of Sahasa Bhima, the Chalukyan emperor that the Poet Ranna, emperor among poets, taking refuge at the holy roots of Kalpavriksha which are the holy feet of Srimad Ahavamalla, has composed for Sri Satyashraya, glory of his clan, foremost among warriors, supreme lord, king of kings, ruler of the Earth, the refuge of men, king of all the world.Pañcamāśvāsam

Canto Five 

Beloved of the Goddesses of Wealth and Victory, Destroyer of the Kuru clan, who drives away the enemy's abundant pride, whose flag bears the king of animals - Is the valorous Bhima of battle any ordinary man?! 

As he was listening, the king of the Kurus came upon the prince (Dushasana) who lay in a river of blood caused by Bhima's mace like an iron bolt, 

Deva! Here, Bhima killed the Kalinga king's army of elephants. Deva! Here, Bhima swallowed all the Kauravas so eagerly. Deva! Here, Bhima dipped his face and sucked Dushasana's blood. Deva! Here, Bhima, like a rut elephant, fought Bhagadatta's elephant with such determination.2 

He rolled Dushasana in the dust, clobbering his flesh into fine pieces – he ate him. He gulped his blood down still the enemy of Hidimba was unsatisfied.

As Sanjaya spoke, as he walked not giving him full ear, he saw his brother's eye pecked by crows, his intestines hauled out by vultures, jackals pulling apart ribs, foxes drawing the nerves, barking dogs holding the veins, jackals biting at the throat, lowly pishachis rolling his body in the dust, betalas wringing his back, terrifying rakshasis breaking his skull with a knife, female prētas lowered their mouths to Dushasana and wailed because Bhima had drunk up his blood already. Out of an overflowing love for his brother, he chased them away, and unable to control his grief, 

Weeping with each step, Duryodhana gazed at his beloved brother: He went after his waist and crushed his ribs to pieces! He pulverized his flesh as he stomped on him Then, he tore his chest apart. He roared as he glugged and glugged down his blood. How will I abide with my grief if my enemy lives? 

He stood there, recalling his many griefs, 

His life is in another world, his immense flesh 

fills pishachas His blood lies in the enemy's stomach. A long nailed rakshasi cradles his head in her palm. His body lies in the Kuru land - Son of Gandhari, Duryodhana's brother, Oh Dushasana! Bhima's terrible club has turned you into the five elements! 

He lamented bitterly,

The one who killed you is still alive, isn't he? I let him live, making no effort to kill him. I am still here, aren't I? Is it right to not reciprocate your affection? 

I drank from mother's breast, then you had your soma. I relished splendid food and you followed. In childhood and always, you did not trespass the limits of humility. Yet you have gone forward into death. Haa! my little calf, Dushasana! Battle has turned order into disorder. 

The Light of the Kuru Clan lamented, 

He drank my brother's blood - I will drink his blood together with his life - My name is Duryodhana! How else will I erase Dushasana's indignity? 

Then Red-Eyed One with bloodshot eyes, angered at the sight of his brother's body, took his leave, 

The Kuru king saw the king of Anga broken by Arjuna's shaft as he walked across that terrifying battlefield, strewn with corpses of elephants, horses and men. 

Bereaved by the death of an adored son and brother, the king felt his grief swell at the sight of his beloved friend, Karna. Watching him, Sanjaya thought that it was like a swollen blister on a wound,4

He lifted the chariot's wheel from the swallow of the earth, His feet were so charmingly poised. An arrow gracefully drawn to his ear by his right fist: The Lord of Anga leaned against his flag staff as though laughing at the unfulfilled duty of the dead, treating his master's task with contempt.

Then the king of kings saw the Daymaker's son and his tears began to flow. His throat turned hoarse. His burning grief felt intolerable, 

We were always three, certainly: Me - he - you. He died and only you and I remained. Now you are dead too! Where have you gone, Angadhipati! 

How will I rule without you? Can I think of living without you? Tell me! Can I make a truce with our enemies without you? No, it cannot be done, Angadhipati! 

Your son Vrishasena and my own son, my beloved Lakshana are dead. 

You were to console me! Instead, here I have come to condole you, Angadhipati! 

Did I heed any slight against you? Did I transgress in my conduct? I do not know - Was I vengeful towards heroic and loving martyrs? Did I disagree with you? Tell me, Angadhipati!

Today, I remain. Pandu's sons live. Tell me, Karna: They've killed you, they've killed Dushasana. Are they going to survive? Not a chance, Angadhipati! 

He lamented in many manners, 

I have seen the Sun's child and Dushasana lie in such a state. Still my breath does not leave me - My heart is as a rock - Is there another like me? 

Reproaching himself, 

Fate! You have caused me to see the destruction of my children, the death of my dear friend and my brothers – What more will you make me see? I, performer of wicked deeds, am wholly without merit.

When he said this, Sanjaya said, “Lord, why do you prattle in this manner?' 

Mirror of the Kuru clan! 

You have made the offering ritual water with your torrent of words, the fire of your anger has performed the final rites. Forget now the son of Aharpati.11

He was a guru to ritual initiates, a minister for welfare, a king who protected his kingdom, a confidantel2 in matters of sensual delight, deadly in battle like an assiduous elephant, daring in undercover operations, a friend to laugh with ... such was his life. How could Duryodhana forget Karna?l3 

The son of Ravi was prime target for Indra's son, Now he does not appear before me He cannot hear my words. Beheaded! How will he see or hear now when there is no head?

Blinded by grief at being separated from Karna, he grew angry with Arjuna, 

The child of the Sun has a face like the full moon.14 My grief is a great ocean swelling at his memory. 

The oceanic fire of my anger has swallowed my grief completely. 

Sanjaya saw the Bearer of the Serpent-Flag pouring grief over his anger. He watched it transform as he walked. Realizing his anger over not winning, Sanjaya said, “Deva! Bhishma lies just here, please come! Let us not ignore our elder's wishes. Consult your elder before starting your chosen task.' Without dismissing

his elders and Sanjaya's advice, he came to pay his respects to the elder one, the son of the River who lay on a bed of arrows. Gandhari's son gazed at the son of Ganga, 16 

His body was subject to celestial weapons and broken by Arjuna's innumerable arrows. Still he did not forget Mukunda, recalling him several times. What a pitiable condition the enemy has left the Kuru king in. How had the supreme yogi become so infatuated? 

38 

A twin arrow supports his head, the arrow-cot feels like a bed of cotton. The resplendent son of the Celestial River lies there in a repose of weapons.

When the king of kings saw the son of the River his throat turned hoarse, 

Foregoing humility, I rejected my teachers and elders' friendly advice You fought with Indra's son because of my acrimony against the son of the Wind - you were obliged to! Oh, son of the Sindhu, is my sinful desire the reason for your plight?

He heard his grandson repenting and the approach of footsteps. His shiny white eyes like ponds of graceful, blooming lilies, extended to his ears.

Astonished, he saw Dhritarashtra's forlorn son come and realized the circumstances of the war, 

Where is the white chowrie? Where is your bright royal umbrella? 

O Serpent Flag Bearer, where is your lion throne? The rows of fluttering flags that follow you? Where are they? 

Where is Bhanumati? Where are your concubines? Where is the song and music the dance of graceful women? 

Where are they? Your hundred sons and hundred brothers. Son, tell me! Where is your fourfold army? Where are they all, atirathas, samarathas, maharathas, ardharathas?

The king of kings restrained the son of the River's lament, “We know you are a devout soul, well versed in these matters. Do not be so sorrowful.' He explained why he had come and his decision to continue the war. Bhishma pondered for a while, "My son, Brahma was born from the lotus in the navel of Vishnu. The seven sages were born from his mind. Soma was born of the three eyed Atri, venerable in all the world, and from Soma came the lineage of the Moon. There were numerous kings in the lineage of the Moon. Among those was King Satya who had a son named Bharata.20 From him came the Bharata line. In the Bharata line, was born Pratipa, the incomparable and strong, and to him were born four sons, Shantanu, Bahlika, Vinuta and Devapiyum. I was born to that Shantanu and Gangadevi and I have been celibate since I was young. With Yojanagandhi as Satyavati was known, my father Shantanu had two sons, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. In their absence the line was in danger of coming to an end. From Krishna Dvaipayana's (Vyasa's) boons three sons were born: Dhritarashtra to Ambika, Pandu to Ambalika while the concubine had Vidura. And so there has been from the line of the Moon no interruption in that Bharata clan till today. There has been no rift within the clan until it came to you. Listen to me if you wish. Make an agreement with the Pandavas. Make a treaty. Let it continue as it was. I will try too for they do not disobey me. They do not disagree with me. Do as I say and don't disagree with me. Duryodhana just smiled. 

My mind is made up. 

I have come to offer my respects and leave. Did I come for advice to orchestrate a truce? Ajja, tell me what is to be done now.

Does a hero suffer from doubt? Is the martyr ever shaken? Does the brave one expect help? Can the Noble One live another life? Will the virtuous turn to stealing? Is a dutiful man a murderer? Is the minister known to exercise free will? Can an upright man spread slander?21 I am a man of integrity and manliness, how can I make a truce with the sons of Kunti? 

46 

Is this a battle for the earth? I fight for my self-respect before the sons of Pandu. This barren earth killed the son of Dinapa - How can I live in union with her again? 

The son of Death stands with his brothers. If Duryodhana, who has lost all his brothers, makes a truce, would he not be mocked by his friends and enemies? 

48 

Without demolishing his enemy and feeding him, flesh and fat, to the bhutas, Without the lotus faces of his adversaries concubines going pale, Without relieving his family of their grief and bringing happiness, Will the Bearer of the Serpent Flag make a truce with the Pandavas?

Arjuna and Bhima killed my beloved aide and my beloved brother. So long as they are alive, and as long as I remain, Ajja, I will not comply. First, I will kill the two of them and later, let us make a truce with the son of Death! Let my grief subside, then, would I refuse a truce? 51 

He spoke again, 

Living together is not an option at all. Anyway, we cannot come to an agreement. Without you, without my archery teacher, when Karna is absent and Dushasana isn't here who will I rule the kingdom with? For whom will I put on a display of riches? Whom will my amusements entertain? 

If they divide the share and give me a white umbrella and some wealth what is in it for me? Not this for me, not this! My fists will claim with my undivided 

self-respect and the unhalved realm. 

When my hundred sons and hundred brothers faced their death, I exploded in anger. Aren't the dead reborn? Slaying the Pandavas, I will fulfil my resolve.

Ajja, I will not stay without fighting Either the Pandavas will survive or I today Let dominion over this land go to the Pandavas or to the Kauravas. 

Bhishma realized that king of kings would go ahead, relying on his innate bravery. He shook his head repeatedly in wonder, 

Even if the seven deep oceans and seven lofty peaks grow beyond their limit, the king of the Kurus will not abandon his self-respect or give away his auspicious prosperity to foes. 

56 

As the fire in the lac palace was the seed, the dreadful poison became the sprout. A lively game grew into a gamble of tender shoots. Grabbing the hair of Panchala's daughter was the flower; it grew into a tree of enmity. 

The fruit will be the loss of his thighs and crown. Will it whither if it is not successful? 

Then he decided, 

The Storm's son destroyed the younger Kuru brothers. His heavy, iron studded mace will break the two thighs of the Lord of the Kurus into pieces. 

The earth surrounded by seven oceans will subject to his one royal umbrella This is the talk of the people. Will the Chalukya Lion prove them wrong?170

Srivadhu reposes in the might of his powerful arms. Beloved of the Goddess of Victory, the king of the Earth is famously called the Daring Bhima. 

The son of Ganga appreciated him silently, 

Pulling out an arrow from his belly to fashion a quill, Sindhu's son wrote on a flag with ink taken from a rut elephant and sent it to the blind king. 

Signing the letter in his name, he said, “My grandson will not accept my advice. As long as you and Gandhari are alive, urge Duryodhana, Shining Light of the Kuru Clan, to make a truce to live as we did before. As he placed the letter in Sanjaya's hands and sent him to Dhritarashtra, the Kuru king looked at Sindhu's son, 

The exalted Kuru line is destroyed by disrepute. I am responsible for its coming apart Still, I am the Kuru king! You ask for a truce? Ha! The crown is mine!

These two long arms are made for heroism; victory is left to the Gods. Ajja! I will shine, not stain the Bharata race. 

No, let it go, Ajja, I have ended the truce with a mangalamahashri.' I will not follow your advice in this instance It is not wrong to cross over your command. Please do not insist. Amazed by the strength of that unmatched boldness, Mandakini's son praised him.

Guru, Bhishma, Arka's son and countless 

great warriors are dead – no one remains. This singular Kaurava remains alone unshaken. He will maintain no kinship with Kunti's sons Alone and ready to rumble – Is there anyone who stands like this hero?2 

The son of Ganga praised him silently. 'Time will tell what is inauspicious.' Following the adage, he said, 'My child, you won't listen anyway. If you have resolved to fight Kunti's sons, hide somewhere till Baladeva returns from his pilgrimage. You must deceive time till Ashvatthama, Kripa and Kritavarma join you. Train in the art of the Jalamantra and spend this night in the Vaisampayana lake - it lies to the north of the Kurukshetra, and tomorrow, well, do as you like. 

“That is a big blessing! I agree.' With his advice and instructed in the Jalamantra, he took leave of the patriarch of the Kuru family. As he walked towards the battlefield with his mace, he thought to himself,

Surrounded by bees/arrows and lily-petalled eyes/skulls, the very abode of the Goddess of Victory this flower pond resembled, to the Kaurava's eyes, a killing field. 

The Rajahamsa of the Kuru lake watched the Rajahamsa bird, the tortoise that bore the earthly realm watched at the tortoises, the Kuru chakreshwara of the Bharatas gazed at the chakravaka birds, fish-eyed Bharata emperor saw fishes, the excellent lotus among men saw the lotuses, the lily of the Kuru lineage saw lilies, he whose sole bore the shankha and chakra marks saw the six footed bees, his majesty listened to the majestic sounds with curiosity. He washed the streaks of blood off his body, washed his hands, feet and face, rinsed his mouth, performed the acamana, paid his respects to the water deities and chanted the jalamantra, 

He enjoyed the world of men His glory is the fortune of the heavens The Lord of the Kurus entered the Vaishampayana lake as if it were the Abode of the Serpents.? 

Earth's Kuru Guardian who nurtures the middle realm became the ruler of the western direction by making the waters his abode. 8180

After Shalya was slaughtered, Duryodhana was not to be found anywhere. Dharma's son thought to himself, there ought to be a reason for this', and so he consulted Krishna. Bhima, destroyer of the Kurus overheard Dharma's son consulting Krishna, Bearer of the Garuda flag, 

“A sham is what it is – the oath I swore in the Kaurava court! Oh, I couldn't prevent her face from not turning pale! The itch in my arms has not stopped; Suyodhana is still alive - what do I do?' He, who caused disarray among the Kauravas, was restless and agitated.

So unhappy, Bhima desired to powder the Kuru Guardian's two hill-like thighs with his pulverizing mace that was like Indra's bolt, to cut the Kuru Lord's arms that were like tree branches with a deep cleaving axe-like mace, plough his broad chest and render the Bearer of the Serpent Flag into two, shatter his ugly forehead that was like a stone inscription, knock the jewelled crown off the man who humiliated Draupadi, powder it under his feet and with the blood that flowed from Suyodhana's chest, he would quench the blazing flames of his anger.

I will kill my enemy and sacrifice him to the fire of my anger. And if I fail, I will offer myself to Agni, oh yes! roared the Destroyer of Kurus, swearing his oath. 

The daring Bhima, Destroyer of the Kurus, prostrated before the One who has No Enemyl2 with the Panchabhutas as his witness, 

How much will Draupadi suffer, she leaves her hair loose. How long will my brothers and I watch her sadness? You unsympathetic man! Your mind feels no pain when looking at Panchali - Fine! Be that way! I will settle this anger, Narendra! My enemy is a tree that I shall pull out by the roots!13 

I will not be an obedient man Today, you are not my respected elder.14 O King - let me go! I will squeeze the Kaurava's throat and return!

That day, in front of me, he caught her by the forehead and humiliated the daughter of Fire 

I was so inflamed, I humbled his fat pride! Can I really wait to finish off the Kuru chief? 

26 

Then, the Annihilator of the Kurus, the ruinous comet falling on the Kuru abode, his face deformed by anger, absorbed in the death of Gandhari's son, gritting his teeth, biting down on his lip, furrowing his eyebrows, with a dreadful forehead – readied to hurl the family into the many directions. He will be responsible for the death of the Red Eyed One: his red stare is terrible to behold, his step is heavy with excitement. He takes his oath with a roar that is greater than the roll of clouds at the time of the great deluge - it extends to all the directions. 

He, who finished Suyodhana's brother and sucked his blood dry, was spurred by intense angers and extended his victorious mace forward like it were Yama's staff at the time of dissolution. He stormed off in search of Duryodhana, 

A young elephant in the Kuru banana grove, A lamp to fell the enemy-moth The son of the Wind has gone looking for the Kuru chief all over the Kuru land. 

27 

When his Guru would say, "You can't hit the target', he'd run after the arrow, flying with the wind to stop it Now, he flies hither-thither at wind's speed.

He ran forward then back, up then down, twice - three times over, running pell-mell on the Kuru field, elephants like mountains

fell beating against the hard diamond weapon. He lifted elephants with their metal armour who had fallen on their tusks, searching. He battered horses with his terrible mace, chopped them into bits, and with his hands, he scattered the horses from Kambhoja and Turkey. He searched under chariots, broken and scattered by his arrows for the man in hiding. He kicked away crowns of fallen heroes with his powerful feet which threw up a flood of blood, jabbing at the heaps of fat, peering through balls of flesh, looking between piles of nerves, climbing heaps of bones, through the slush of brains, separating guts as he searched, stepping on mounds of teeth, looking through every corner of hills of headless bodies, listening to each sound like a grammarian, like a hunter he tracked footprints, like an eagle searches for the serpent's hood, like a doctor studying a hostile disease in the body, like Parshurama who searched for Kshatriyas and killed 21 times, rendering them childless. He created lakes of foaming blood to make an offering to his father and mother. Dipping himself in those five lakes, he looked around at the 48 gavudas16 on the Kuru field and burned with anger for Duryodhana is nowhere to be found, 

Where is that man responsible for burning the lac palace? Where is he who schemed to poison Marut's son's food and kill him? Where is that criminal who humiliated Krishne dragged her by the hair in the game of dice? Where is he who lured us into the illusionary assembly? Where is Suyodhana?190

He arrived at the Kuru king's doors, roaring like a lion, causing the stomachs of the camp guards to sink, as if to destroy the wombs of women in the camp, 

Who died in the war? Who survived? What has become of my sons? His enemy's mother waits at palace door with her attendants. 

She is surprised to see the Formidable Fort of the Pandavas approaching her, occupying the directions, extending to the sky - all encompassing. Gandhari cried, trembling: Who is that who whirls his mace? Is it Bhima, or a demon who has devoured the Kauravas? 

She was taken aback seeing him,

Offended by her words, Bhima, though bitter, paid his respect as is the convention with elders and proclaimed aloud, 

Listen, King Dhritarashtra! Listen, Oh Mother Gandhari! I killed your sons - all hundred of them, struck them with my club. I doused flames of anger in Dushasana's blood – broke open his chest and drank. I've come to swallow the Red Eyed Man who in mounting anger committed a hundred sins. 

35 

With folded palms, Gandhari pleaded with Jarasandha's enemy, 

We grieve the loss of all our sons Here we are still breathing Do me just this for me, Bhima Devour us first, then take my son! 

Now the Wind's son turned towards the blind king, 

O Kuru son, Promoter of the Kuru family, Your child is a tiger in the Kuru forest. If I lay my eyes on him, I will roll him over and kill him right before you Bhima, the hunter has come!

Meanwhile, the hunter-messengers, Vindhyaka and Jalaka, arrived and prostrated at some distance. 'Oh Lord! We have searched all over the Kurukshetra for Duryodhana but haven't found him. At midday, as the Sun beat down on our heads we went to the much liked Vaishampayana lake for a drink. There we saw prints of a plough, axe, lotus, conch and a wheel. Those footprints led to the water but there weren't any prints entering the water. They accompanied him to inform Dharma's son. Vishnu, who presides over all creation, existence and dissolution listened keenly to their words and determined, 

He entered by chanting the water-spell on the instructions of the son of the Heavenly River. He allows time to pass. Tomorrow, Balarama, Kripa and Ashvatthama will join the Bearer of the Serpent Flag. Best to get hold of Suyodhana before they arrive - Could we win after? 

38 

Gathering Dharmaraja and the others, the Lotus-navelled One said: 'Leave immediately and surround the lotus pond, drag him out and humiliate him.' He accompanied Dharmaraja and others and saw the signs pointed to by the hunter messengers. He reco gnized the Duryodhana's footprints without any mistake, and he was left without doubt in his mind, 

The Kuru king's retreat is a strategy no Bharata son has chosen, said Dharma's son bowing his head in shame. 

Dharma's son bowed his head at Duryodhana's ignominious deed,

He came howling to the pond's verge, beating drums, blowing conch shells, striking kettledrums, blustering on long horns, playing five different great instruments, and yet he couldn't lure Duryodhana out. Then Nakula was called on to shout his name, 

They call you Distinguished Warrior! Moon of the Kuru race! How can you stay submerged? 

Oh Duryodhana, the name you made for yourself is soiled in infamy in the mire of this lake.

You hid away during this terrible battle. I have killed all your clansmen in anger. as I pursued you. Oh fool! Do you think you will survive there in the lake?

The lotuses were partially scorched and birds charred on the wing by the flames of Bhima's anger. All the sand in the lake has turned hot as if to roast peanuts.5 

Baka's Slayer is here! The name 'Baka' will anger him - he'll kill us! said the Baka cranes who didn't wait and scattered swiftly from the lake. 

An assembly of water creatures leapt frantically, frightened by Bhima's angry calls. Imagine: the lake is breaking up leaping toward the end of Brahma's egg. 

The flames of Bhima's severe anger set the lake's waters to boil as rice is set to cook the lake's fish boiled like cooked rice. 

As all the creatures in that pond felt the life go out of them, became like rice balls swollen with grief, the one with the lion on his flag roared,210

Hearing that howl defeats the lion's roar Hearing that howl humbles the rumble of clouds. the red eyed Serpent Flag Bearer began to sweat though under water. 

Sweating and unable to stand his anguish, he was consumed by acute anger and ignored the Water-Spell, 

Won't my enemies laugh at me? 

There will be no talk of my strength or my enchanted ability to remain under water. They will say that the Bearer of the Serpent Flag lost his strength that he plunged into the water. 

Chi !, they will say, How unmanly! Hiding in a lake after Shalya's death! It is not just that. You've ruined your reputation - I am responsible for bejewelled fame losing lustre! 

To protect life that is as light as a blade of grass, do I make myself a light weight? though I am among those men of respected lineage, self-pride and sacrifice. 

Duryodhana worried, Listening to the agitated Fish he grew agitated: How can I remain here? That incensed man taunts me! 

All the hydro-spells that the wicked royal heir was equipped with have yielded nothing but he has not lost his pride.

As he emerged from the pond with a crown glittering with precious stones that threw a stunning rainbow of light over the lotus pond. Now the lily pond turned dark as the Bearer of the Serpent Flag emerged with an iron mace in his arm, like a festoon. 

The Kuru king rose from the water jewels gleam on his crown scattering a red glow across white buds: the lotus garden turned a pearly red. 

Waves lashed violently against his thighs and head suggesting a Kaurava's shattered thighs and shattered crown. 

Like a fiery Rudra rising from the nether world as it dissolves, he broke through the lake's centre, heroic and proud. "Where is Bhima?' Like a wondrous Nata with a trembling forehead and bloodshot eyes, his red eyes roved across the eight directions as he waved his mace. 

30 

Bhimasena, who conquered a terrifying army with the strength of this arms, approached the Kaurava, nodding his head ap preciatingly at the fearless Bearer of the Serpent Flag, a hero without compare. 

As I drank your brother's blood dry you fled to the lake in fear! Don't you recognize the great warrior chasing you - the Destroyer of the Kauravas?

Duryodhana grew incensed at the flood of mockery, 

Beloved son of the Yama! You, Gandivi, the twins – Where were you all? Where was your manly pride when, before me, Dushasana's forceful arms grabbed dear Krishne's hair by the roots? Oh unmanly fellow! Who made you men today? 

32 

Oh son of the Wind! She is a wife to five men! When he dragged her in, Dushasana didn't just fetch her, he brought me the whole world: both glory and Lakshmi. 

When the asura demon took the Earth to the nether world, Hari followed and restored it. I too have taken the Earth out of your reach and wanted to bring it back. Would I go into the lake out of fear??

You hid in the forest eating tubers and rotting fruit beyond the four directions Now you stand tall and speak words perfumed with epithets and heroism!

Setting the water to boil, washing rice to cook fit to wash hands and brass vessels - this is your work! Who gave the Matsya king's cook a job apart from this? 

A smile spread across Bhima's face at the jabs and chiding, 

I cooked for others to respect my elder brother's word. Listen, Kuru son! I will cook this flesh of your body and feed it to the ghosts! 

Remember the threat and humiliation at Chitrangada's hands? Remember your plight during the capture of the cows? How you fled in fear as I drank your brother's blood! Remember each of your past defeats, Oh Kaurava!

Tell them to come, Krishna - I will destroy them all!

When the Serpent Flag Bearer spoke to the Bearer of the Garuda 

Flag, 

The Lotus Navelled One heard Duryodhana and yelled to Bhimasena: Duryodhana speaks so meekly - How can you speak such words in front of me, Bhima? 

43 

With folded palms, Dharma's son said to Dhritarashtra's son. 

Refrain from war, stay calm. Take all of it not only your share - Rule over the entire earth – be happy. 

O Jewel among kings of the Kuru clan! Take hold of the Earth's wheel, set aside your vengeance. Admit us into your service. Such base thoughts are unbecoming. Let our agreement be affectionate. Brother, rest and be at peace. This is our consolation.

Then Hari said: Duryodhana, Dharma's son speaks well. Follow his advice - Be king, rule the Earth and be happy. 

At this Bhima quipped, 

You asked for five villages, he did not accept your truce you went with. He is a self-respecting man who has lost his sons and brothers - will he agree to a truce? 

Duryodhana agreed with Bhima, 

First, I will kill Arjuna who executed the Ina's son. Then the Wind's son who killed my brother. Oh Lotus Navelled One! I won't desist from matching blow with blow!10 

Oh, now you talk like a mediator! Oh, now to be bedfellows with them! Oh, now to make an agreement with them! I dismissed talk of truce earlier, will I agree to one now? 

He responded angrily at the inappropriate blame the Lotus Navelled One had levelled, 

That day when Jarasandha handed you a terrific humiliation, you came up stealthily behind Bhima and killed him. 

They called you God then and you were celebrated.

Purified by the flowing waters of all the tirthas he visited and bathed in to wash away his sins, Sankarshana came, like a wandering Himalaya mountain, to Suyodhana. The Pandavas were standing in a huddle, while the Swami of the Kuru clan stood alone, without companions, like a poor fellow on the verge of death. He looked at him, then at the Devaki's son's lotus-face in astonishment, his thoughts attached to Duryodhana with love, he blessed the serpent flag bearer who prostrated before him. Unwilling to bless the Bearer of the Eagle Flag and the five Pandavas, he looked instead at his brother and the five men with anger, 

Through the power of your mantra Brahma survived in your navel Now as the world dissolves, what do you have in mind for Jewel among the Kauravas?

My elder brother, you are a respectable man. Please listen attentively without anger: I asked for only five villages for the Pandavas. He disregarded Drona, Dhritarashtra and Sindhu's son. Ask Suyodhana and believe. 

The Bearer of the Serpent Flag does not speak in two tongues. 

When he said this, Duryodhana said: Why are you angry? The Pandavas are not at fault! I did not agree then. Did I ever speak of an agreeable relationship with them? My children and brothers are dead and I have seen sorrow. How can I bear even a moment? Whatever my enemies deal, I am prepared. 

They will watch me fight - Be sure of this - not another word! Baladeva, carrying his pounding stick, applauded the Kuru Lord silently. 

Sankarshana praised the undisputed hero, the king of kings. Speechless and surprised at his determination, he looked at Dharma's son and said, 'Any one among the five may fight and if Duryodhana wins, he will rule the kingdom and the remaining four will serve him. At this, Bhima stepped forward, 

Let Dharma's son be. Leave Arjuna out, leave Madri's renowned sons alone. I am ready to destroy this wicked man. Oh Halayuddha! Show me that Kaurava!14

It is known that I am the Kauravas' foremost enemy. It is not proper for you to claim your share here – He has been my equal from the start. 

63 

And so, Dharma's son and the others arranged a dharmayuddha between Maruti - an Indra whose Vajra weapon breaks down the Mountain of the Kuru clan, and the Bearer of the Serpent Flag who wickedly oversaw the sinful indignity committed with Panchali's hair, 

Consider the order: He is the middle born among the Pandavas and will fight the enemy Elder to Arjuna, is it not proper that he be at the forefront?15 

64 

With the Lotus Navelled One and Baladeva as witnesses, the Lord of the Kurus shook Bhima's hand. Celestial beings praised the Kuru Master's heroism. 

Then they were invited to the dharmayuddha, 

Nowhere on the Kurukshetra is there a spot untouched by the hundreds of corpses. Eager to fight Bhima cleared an arena for battle.

For Sri Ramani I make my chest an abode, thought the daring Bhima, the comet bringing ruin to the Kurus as the duel was about to begin. 

Eager to fight, daring Bhima thought of Dronacharya paid his respects to him, and Duryodhana paid his respects to Baladeva. The superior mace was thirty angula in length with a circumference of a thousand angula with a tip of eight angula. The medium mace was twenty-six angula in length, a hundred angula in circumference, and four angula at the tip. The inferior mace was eighteen angula in length, thirty-six angula in circumference, and two angula at the tip. 

As they are supreme heroes, Bhima and Duryodhana chose the superior mace decorated with gold gilding that extend to ten angula. There were five stances:alidha, pratyalidha, samapada, vaishnava, and mandala. There were four kinds of strikes: hitting on the left, the right, outside and inside. There were eight ways to hit: vilambita, aakunchita, aasphotita, aakshipta, udbhramita, digbhramita, uchita viruddha, achintya. They stood in a wide field. They were adept in these techniques and assumed the wide, vaishaka stance,

They stood firm in their hate Astonishing demons with grotesque knitted eyebrows Waging looks of war their eyes red in extreme anger. 

Offerings of blood sacrifices to Guardians of the Directions, or showering red hibiscuses – such deep redness spreads from the corners of Bhima and Duryodhana's eyes. 

As if spitting fire, as if sprinkling warm blood all over, They look at each other with wide eyes as though to swallow the other up. 

He drank wicked Dushasna's red blood it was indigestible and oozed from the red copper eyes of the destroyer of the Kuru clan 

Like angry Udaya and Asta, mountains of dawn and dusk,4 the two men, Bhima and the Serpent Flag Bearer stood tall and ready on sturdy legs with their maces 

Slowly, slowly, they advanced towards each other Slowly, slowly, they extended their maces forward Slowly, slowly, they rolled their maces Slowly, slowly, they waved and heaved then pushed forward without rest.

He placed his left leg forward, His right leg retreated to block his mace Bhima and Duryodhana: how appealing their beauty is! hurling their mace with steady hands. 

Following the plan, they rained blows – ducking, hurling, straightening up tripping then stumbling, they struck. The two heroes fought defiantly. 

When their feet hit the ground, the nether world trembled. 

The Earth grew fearful and the world Above was bewildered. This the duel of maces between Duryodhana and Bhima agitated all the worlds. 

DHAP-DHATT-POTT! DHOPP- DHOGAP-DIDHIL-BHUDIL! 

They fell upon each other in a frenzy Assailing one another with brute force. 

Sparks flew from the maces like meteors falling in the day, dazzling the eyes of the unblinking gods who wondered at the embattled maces of the Kuru and Pandava, terrifying and wondrous. 

Mace strikes mace 

fiery sparks flew in the eight directions the dust under their feet rose to the sky. The gods grew frightened of the great warriors.

Sparks shower on Kuru ground, Bala, the Lotus Navelled One and spectators watched as the famed Kuru and Pandava enemies fought without regard for the future. 

On the feet, lower thighs, upper thighs buttocks, trunk, chest, neck shoulders, back, throat - lifting to smash each other on the crown. 

Raising their feet off the ground, they stumble, lunging forward, swaying in and out, to the left to the right, in perfect stance without breaking alignment, they fought furiously. 

Like two lions smeared with elephant blood, Like two beautiful red flame of the forest trees Like two rocky-red mountains, like two red fragrant elephants The two heroes: the Kuru king and the destroyer of the Kurus were smeared with blood. 

Take this one for your pride, Swallower of Kalinga elephants! For gobbling my brothers – take this second blow! Your anger sucked the blood spurts from Dushasana's chest - you take this third blow! Duryodhana raised his mace and struck Bhima ruthlessly. 

He taunted and hit him,240

This one is for burning the house of lac! This one for the poisoned food fed with ill-will! This one for cheating at dice! This is for humiliating Panchali! This for inviting us to the assembly of deceit! Bhimasena hit him mercilessly with his mace, in five places for his five wicked deeds: on his legs, arms, wide chest, cheeks and on the centre of his head. 

He hit him without a care, 

The Earth trembled under their feet, The guardian elephants retreated from the horizons, Hurling maces confused the Vidyadharas who parked their vehicles some distance away. The battle between Bhima and Duryodhana appeared like Bhairava's roar at the world's end. 

20 

Fiery sparks flew as their maces rubbed against each other, the sky was filled with smoke like a burning comet falling, like whirling leaves flying in all directions, clouds shone like meteors in the sky circling in different directions, the great primal mountains were confused for the earth seemed to spin, serpents lay coiled like Nagaraja exhaling hot air, causing the waters to boil the fish in the seas – the terrifyingly wondrous battle was on the boil. 

“Duryodhana' – how appropriate the word! Bhima fulfils his name! Surely, Bhima is 'Duryodhana' and the Kaurava is ‘Bhima' Equal in strength, isn't that why they are named so?

Equal in physique, equal in strength Equal in expertise, equal in the stride of their arms they proceeded in circles against the other, turning their maces, unable to conquer the other. 

They tried to outdo the other's skill, outdo each other's vision, outdo the other in speed, outdo the other's strength, outdo the other's punch outdo the other in anger, outdo the other's vigour the Kuru and Pandu sons could not overpower the other. 

Like a man fighting against his shadow, it was impossible to win over the other. Duryodhana was furious, 

The Kuru king leaped like a Vidhyadhara into the sky, whirling his mace unceasingly like the spinning Earth like the unceasing turns of the potter's wheel.? 

Colourful mace! The Kuru son waves it like a royal umbrella against the sky as if to show the Wind's son that, surely, he is Emperor! 

He provoked him for it does not befit a warrior to fight without taunting the other.

The Kuru Lord saw an opening - Like a thunderbolt, he struck the Wind's son Stunned, he lost his senses and fainted. 

26 

Struck by Indra's weapon,' he collapsed like a dark mountain. Gandivi was outraged at seeing Bhimasena's state, 

Where's Baladeva gone? Where is the order of truth? I shall not let Duryodhana get away with this! The Bharata warrior caught hold of his Gandiva bow. 

27 

So what if Balarama too grows angry? So what if Krishna grows angry as well? We will smite those angry men! said Nakula and Sahadeva in the excitement of battle. 

28 

Dharma's son thought: Disaster has befallen the Wind's son, Arjuna and the others are angry. The three of them put my truthfulness to shame! 

The Plough Bearer's face beamed Dharma's son bowed his head. Looking at them, the Lotus Navelled One felt disturbed and shot Gandivi a look of caution. 

Gazing at his enemy who had collapsed like a mountain of red rocks,

They say a fallen man cannot be hit. When the Wind's son tumbled on the battlefield, the Lord of the Earth rolled his mace in the sky. 

Just then he remembered that this was a just fight, a dharma yuddha, 

I won't kill a fallen man, he thought. Furiously, he waved his mace over the fallen man that cooled the wind and caused the fainted man to wake.... Don't fathers love their sons? 

The gust of a mace revives a fainted man if he is charitable or a warrior. Pitiable men, the timid and the eunuch are fanned by lotus leaves. 

The son of the friend of Fire woke from his faint but could make out nothing. His dark red eyes flashed as if it were Yama beholding the Kaurava. 

When he woke from his faint, 

The Lotus Navelled One pretended to slap his thigh affectionately and shouted: This is the vital spot! Paying undivided attention, the son of the Wind, and supreme scholar understood.

When he understood the plan, he stood and scratched at the ground with his hands, picked up his awesome mace which lay on the ground and extended it - as a thunderbolt strikes from the sky the true hero wielded his mace; he hit the Kuru king on his terrible thigh. 

36 

When he hit and broke his thighs he fell to the ground, biting his lip: 

The Kuru mountain crumpled as if to say, I will not leave the Earth! 

37 

Effortlessly, with pillar-arms like the trunk of an excellent guardian elephant, he rolled the Kuru Lord over whose thighs had become soft as banana stems. Then he, who fulfilled his vow of breaking his thighs and crown, roared in anger, 

This is the head of the Lord of the Earth consecrated by holy water! This is the head shaded by the white royal umbrella! 

This is the head that would never bow! I will treat this head in a befitting manner! said the cousin who advanced furiously to strike the crown of a man who had lost his thighs. 

38 

Baladeva and the others cried out, Not this way, Not this way! Do not humiliate the Fortunate Lord of the Eleven Hundred Akshohini Army! Chi! How improper it is! As much as they cautioned him, Bhimasena did not care. He kicked away the Kuru king's glittering bejewelled crown with his left foot.10

Under such duress, Duryodhana's crown shook and the gems scattered across like sparks flying from the fire of the great slayer's anger.

Never have I seen such an daring warrior! In the sky, Narada danced to the accompaniment of the gods' propitious instruments. 

Celestial women showered flowers gathered from the divine tree Celestial beings sounded their drums blessing Satyashraya in appreciation. 

Baladeva was disgusted with the force of Bhima's arms, distressed at the Kuru Lord's humiliation and looked at Bhima with rising anger. 

Unwilling to hurt his brother's feelings or bear to see Duryodhana's suffering, he left for Dvaravati, 11

Daughter of Fire! In the blaze of the ritual sacrifice, Dharmaraja is the consecrator, the four of us perform the rites, the killer of Mura is the preacher, while you took the vow. Your humiliation fans the fire, the Kaurava Lord is sacrificial animal. I offer the Fire of my fury to make this sacrifice possible.

The Kaurava's fresh meat is a good offering; it has satisfied my burning anger. I have taken my ritual bath in the blood that gushed from the intolerable beating Duryodhana's body suffered.

Her beautiful waist is bound and brilliant, captivating the heart. I cannot describe her beauty. 

57 

Her breasts resemble water pots filled to the brim, three ripples across her belly are clear to see, her navel whirls in a mandala below, the streak of belly hair is a peacock feather, her gold waistband hugs her buttocks well, The enchanting form of woman incites erotic passion like the one born within the body.17 

58 

The Lord of her Body's Longings grabbed her flowing curly tresses: a fortress in the forest, swam in the water-fort of her large buttocks, and climbed the hill forts that were her high breasts. as though he feared her beloved Bhima who looks at her youthful form and thinks isn't she the Durga/fort of the king of Angaja? 

Should lips not be just so? Should such closely bounded breasts not just so? Should tender arms not be like just so? Should brilliant thighs not be just so? Should a beautiful waist not be just so? Should eyes not smile just so? Isn't her beauty that of Lakshmi emerging from the lake?

Twelve years on, unwearied by daily stale meal when sorrow subsides and rust is wiped away, 

then like gold, a woman is aglow! 

Born from the sacrificial fire, her touch is soft like the pleasing parijata flower, her wide eyes are a garland of blossoming flowers that extend to her ear, and as she embraces him with her glance, he is relieved of his battle fatigue, 

He fulfilled his vow sworn against Dhritarashtra's son and Draupadi whose vengeance compelled him – she fulfilled her vow too. Having done his duty, this Irivabedanga is a Siddha!

Hidimba's killer broke the Kaurava Lord's gem studded crown, in the Kurukshetra drenched in blood splatter and crushed elephants' brains where he raised his hand circling his mace in the sky. He prostrated at his elder's lotus feet and said: 

63 

Listen O Hari! Listen up, Dharmaraja, Listen son of Surendra! Madri sons – listen both of you! Each letter of Bhima's vow has been fulfilled. Our work is done, isn't it? Drinking that wile, wicked Dushasana's blood, tying Panchali's hair and breaking the crown of the Kuru king!

Overjoyed, Hari, Dharmaraja, Surendra's son, Madri's sons and Krishne gave him a ritual bath, smeared him with musk, sandal, agarwood and a paste of kashmira flowers They tied an arm bracelet and other ornaments and worshipped Bhima's arms. 

65 

At that time, 

The daring Bhima worshipped his mace.18 Flesh, intoxicating blood, decapitated lotus-heads and gritting teeth: with these grotesque puja essentials he honoured with circumambulations proud of his victory, he gave a long salute. 

66 

Having worshipped his arms and his mace, 

Propitious instruments sound their melody into the directions. Like sweet nectar, propitious songs and tones reach the ears. Divine notes ring in enthusiasm. The Chalukya lion entered the camp in festive celebration. 

Here ends the description of the breaking of Duryodhana's crown and thighs, in the eight canto of the Victory of Sahasa Bhima, the Chalukyan emperor that the Poet Ranna, emperor among poets, taking refuge at the holy roots of Kalpavriksha which are the holy feet of Srimad Ahavamalla, has composed for Sri Satyashraya, glory of his clan, foremost among warriors, supreme lord, king of kings, ruler of the Earth, the refuge of men, king of all the world.

Risen from the clan of the Moon Sri Satyanilaya, is a hamsa in the lotus pond living among his older and younger brothers, enjoying its amusements. Doesn't our Daring Bhima dwell in happiness? 

At this happy time, Chakri, the Mover of Time learnt of the arrival of Ashvatthama, the incomparable hero. To avoid any grief, he had Dhrishtadhyumna, Shikhandi, Chekitana, Yudhamanyu, Uttamauja, Shrutasoma and the other Pandava sons watch over the camp, sending them to Hastinapura with elephants, arrows, chariots and infantry. The Blue-limbed One took the five Pandavas to the Nila mountain, home of wild animals, lotuses, fish, lilies and white lotuses. Meanwhile, Bhishma informed Ashvatthama of the repose of the Kaurava lord. 

Ashvatthama2 arrived in a rage: Dark throated with the crescent moon on his head a fiery third eye, bow in hand, bearing a bull on his flag, accompanied by Kripa and Kritavarma

Lotus-eyed Lakshmi appeared before the Bearer of the Bull Flag in a resplendent golden lotus, a white flywhisk in both hands but distressed, her hair filthy and in disarray, speechless and ungraceful. 

The Water-Pot Born's son inquired of the woman, born in the amrita ocean who resides in the breast of the Lotus Navelled Krishna, 'Who are you? Where are you from? Where are you off to? 

Born in churning nectar, I frolicked in lotus ponds, making the Lotus Navelled One's chest a pleasant home. I am that Kamala, till today, the consort of the great Kuru king. Now by Supreme Purushottama command, I will reside with the Pandavas. 

When Drona's son heard that she was moving on Narayana's orders, he smirked, 

Born in the ocean, you waver too much! Surrounded by lotus pollen makes you sentimental!4 You've become a cowherd among Krishna's flock! Lacking discernment, how can you know the distinction between the Purushas?

Lakshmi was a hot bother, her hair in disarray because he grabbed her dark curls and dragged her, as if she were a servile Kuru pot-bearer, to Suyodhana who lay contracted and writhing having been struck by Bhima's mace which broke his thighs and who kicked away his crown. 

Blood oozed and flowed from his cleaved head. Streams of blood ran down his face - he floated, bobbing up and down, in an ocean of blood. 

Dazed by the terrifying mace 

of Kunti's son, the Kuru king lies in yogic stillness in a gush of blood, dispossessed of his thighs.

He said wearily, 

This shattered body, these shattered arms these shattered thighs, this shattered life my crown is shattered and so is my heart Where is the desire to counter them? Revenge requires a goal. 

You wiped off the dusty footprint from my body with your garment 0, son of my Guru! Tell me, can you erase the dust of my humiliation?

It is impossible to win over the Pandavas who have Hari's support. But this Ashwatthama with Ishvara's features is extraordinarily strong - he cannot be conquered!

in parade, surrounded by aged eunuchs and bravado guards with rotund bellies who could barely move. Soldiers waited their turn, greedy soldiers blocked people's way, vile fellows ran away gritting their teeth, heroic opponents prepared to fight the fearless, genuine heroes sought no one's help, heroes come from far and near going about their jobs, heroes carrying their king's command without question, aged heroes counting their victories, illustrious heroes, men who fought with minds intent on their enemies, heroes who fulfilled anything asked of them and armies who fought on land. He watched them in wonder, like a Rudra at the time of the world's dissolution. He made his way to the Himalaya in repentance. Suyodhana, now at ease, leaving Ashwatthama and others, intent on attaining the next world, was ready to breathe his last at the end of the day. 

The face of lotus/lotus-faced friends seemed to diminish. The radiant Sun/king faded as rays/hands grew weak, chakra birds separated/the emperor lost his empire shedding the sky/garment Darkness spread as the Kuru Sun fell.

In the beginning, Shantanu's son fought for ten days, Drona, the archery teacher fought for five days The son of Bhaskara fought for two days, Shalya fought for half a day The duel of maces filled the remaining day. This is how it went, The terrible Bharata war came to an end. 

The war began when Bharani ascended on the thirteenth day of the first fortnight of the month of Margashira. On that day of the Amavasya of the Mula star, the Kaurava line ended.? 

So, the Bharata race was relieved of the burden of war, 

Beloved of Victorious Lakshmi, Adorned by valour, Speaker of truth, Adored by benefactors, Beloved of earthly folk, Without desire for vengeance, Refuge of scholars, Bearing the radiant mark of kingship: Shridevi and Bhudevi came to join the Chalukya Kandarpa.

Beloved of Shri, Jayashri and Dharashri, Goddesses of Wealth, Victory and Earth the Daring Bhima shone in all the worlds and his fame extends to the horizons. 

The killer of Mura, pleased with the Daring Bhima's valour in the victorious war, looked at Dharmaraja, 

The Kuru king's sins caused Arjuna's terrible arrows to cleave Saindha into two, crush the bodies of the ocean-strong army, Karna to meet his death by a spear. Shalya too was killed. Brave Bhishma lay on a bed of arrows. The Bharata war was the victorious Kumarankarama's warfield. 

Headless horses, heads of men, torsos of great heroes scattered elephant heads, warriors with horse faces, Vinayakas are seen, a warfield of Kinnaras? - What praise for Kumaranka Rama's war?290

Arrogant enemies lie on the field, blood mingled with mud. Arrows toppled the heads of kings and headless trunks danced - how terrible! Celestial beings shower flowers attracting bees. This is Kumaranka Rama's warfield - the abode of the bhutas! 

With his terrible mace, Bhima ploughed the Kuru field like Bhairava,watered it with the blood of kings, sowed fresh pearls from foreheads of fallen elephants and reaped a crop of pure fame like the silver hills. 

Kumaranka Rama felt ashamed to face men who stuttered, did not fulfil their promises, 

or were released from battle – he would not look at them! When the vine of fame extends so far, what can I say of his three qualities, his courage, charity and truthfulness? 

The ocean is the boundary of the earth, the ocean's limits are the eight directions. Elephants stand at the end of the directions. His fame extends to the oceans, to the directions and the guardian elephants. Kumaranka Rama's fame stretches a long way. 

Sattiga's fame sprouted on earth, spread to the directions, it touched the sky, watered by the tears of his enemies' women. 

Having praised him, Krishna looked at the face of the Vanquisher of the Kuru line,

When Narayana praised Chalukya Narayana's bravery, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari joined them and Dharma's son prostrated before them. 

He denied us five villages - he did not heed your advice about a truce, Father!

The five of us obey your command – Rule together with us, O blind king, as you did before. Forget your sons, consider us as your own. 

Listening to Dharma's son speak, he said, 

We do not yearn any more for this human life. I have just this one request, Yamaputra! My son, show me each of my princes!

To the Friend of the Lotus was born the Anga king, You were born to Dharma, the enemy of Baka to the Fire's friend, Gandhivi to the Surapa.4 I gave birth to the Daymaker's son. Karna is my first born son and your elder brother. My passionate attachment to you prevented me from revealing it. I killed my son, O Dharmaja! 

21 

Dharma's son and the others were extremely pained at her words and said, 

So the child of the Sun was the eldest brother in line - Why did you not tell us? Had you spoken earlier, the kingdom would have been his. He would rule, we would serve him and live in prosperity but you were wrong in your deed. In this way Kunti's sons reproached Kunti. 

As Pandu's sons grieved, the Purushottama incarnate related many similar examples, taught them the secret of kshatriya dharma, and consoled them. Regaining their balance, they stacked the bodies of Duryodhana and others and employed Brahmins to perform the last rites. They had Karna's body brought there and placed him over the other bodies. With Brahmin priests, they performed the rites themselves with sandalwood and other perfumed materials. They built a teertha for Karna and offered ritual water to send him to the other world. Then with their permission, Kunti, Gandhari, Dhritarashtra and the royal queens went to the forest to perform austerities.

We won this terrible great war - the greatest there has been with your support, Mukunda! Partha is the younger one. I have no fascination for the throne. Coronate Bhima for he brought us victory in war. Let us proceed to Hastinapura. 

Vasudeva instructed Sahadeva to fix the auspicious day and pro ceeded to Hastinapura to coronate Bhima. 

The directions were filled with sounds of beating drums, blessed with vedic chants while lotus-eyed women showered auspicious rice over the Pandava protector, their fortress. 

Then with great pleasure, Krishna coronated the Daring Bhima.

Notes to the Translation 

Canto One 

1. The first chapter is a pīthike which introduces the composition and 

offers praise to the gods, the poet's patron and poets of the tradition. Ranna's patron, Emperor Satyashraya (997-1008 CE) is referred to as Chalukya Narayana. 

Anantabhoga is the serpent with innumerable hoods who resides below the earth. 2. The opening verse is a slēşa, a mode of punning in South Asian literary 

traditions containing two meanings, simultaneously. In this verse, praise is offered, simultaneously, to Vishnu and to Satyashraya, the Chalukyan 

emperor. 3. Kalpavriksha is the wish fulfilling tree in Indra's garden. 4. This verse praises Shiva. But Ranna suggests that Ardhanarishwara 

embraces Gauri. Since he calls his patron Chalukya Narayana, so it suggests that the other half is Narayana (Vishnu). Ranna describes Shiva as Harihara (Shiva and Vishnu). Half of Shiva is Parvati and half of 

Shiva is Vishnu. 5. Brahmi refers to Saraswati who sits on the tongue of Brahma. 6. This slēşa refers to the god Brahma and the king Satyashraya. 7. Dedication to Surya is rare in kāvya. Even though the Chalukyas are 

said to be from the lineage of the moon, there are inscriptions that also claim their lineage from the sun (Parbhani copper plates, vol. 13, Issue 

3, Quarterly Journal of Society of Indian Historical Research, Poona). 8. The invocation is to the goddess Durga. The poet plays on the word 

kuru which means to love as well as to sit as well as kūrasi which 

means sword. 9. Manmatha or Kama is the god of love. 10. Conventionally, the body is described as ornamented in sixteen ways 

while poetry, according to Bharata has thirty-six ornaments. 11. Ammana Gandhavarana refers to a special kind of elephant. 

This slēşa verse refers to the god Ganapati, leader of the ganas as well as the king Satyashraya. 12. The Ghurjara-Pratihara dynasties ruled over North India between the 

304 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

seventh and eleventh centuries, from Ujjain and later Kannauj. However, in this verse, Ranna may be referring to the Chalukyas of Gujarat. Some Rajput clans claim their descent from these dynasties. The connection between the Ghurjaras and the Chalukyas of Gujarat is still a matter 

of debate. 13. Parashurama vowed to kill all Kshatriyas and bathed only after he 

fulfilled his vow. Kuvarankarama is the epithet of Satyashraya. 14. The story refers to Markandeya who was about to be killed by Yama 

but is spared when he embraces a Shivalinga. 15. The practice of standing on an anthill is not quite clear. However, the 

oldest extant work on Kannada poetics, the Kavirājamārgam also mentions an anthill in the same context of surrender, An example of overstating one's excellence: Throw away your weapons. I will not kill you. Bite the grass. Step on the anthill. Prostrate before me. Either get out of this place, 

or roar like a lion and take up a weapon. (3.199) 16. Yuga in puranic lore is an epoch or era within a four-age cycle 

(caturyuga). A complete Yuga starts with the satyayuga, followed by the trētāyuga, the dvāparayuga and the present kaliyuga believed to have begun at the end of the Kurukshetra War. In this conception, the perishable universe is created by Brahma who also takes birth and dies. The period between the birth and death of a Brahma is called a mahākalpa. Each day in Brahma's life is a kalpakāla. Each kalpa is divided into fourteen parts and each part is ruled by a Manu. Each Manu's reign is called a manvantaram, and each one has seventy-one 

caturyugas. 17. It implies that the sun rose in the east. 18. The poet using the term bāhurāhu, to mean an astrological body that 

causes the eclipse. In Puranic lore, Rahu and Ketu were born from the severed throat of a Brahmin who stole the amrita nectar from the gods. The Brahmin's identity was revealed by Surya (Sun) and Chandra (Moon). Hence, Rahu and Ketu swallow the Sun and Moon when they can, but since they were born from two ends of a severed throat, the Sun and Moon are able to emerge from their grasp and become visible 

again. 19. Mārga (Way) was formulated by Dandin to express the diversity of 

Sanskrit styles while emphasizing its unity of Sanskrit literature. Dēsi refers to a local style marked by a directness and grace without the use 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

305 

of complex figures of speech. The Kavirājamārgam theorizes this 

difference. 20. The verse provides us with historical information about patronage among 

the Western Chalukyas in the tenth century CE. 21. Jaina authors emphasize conduct (cāritra), not simply biography. 22. It is said that Ranna belonged to a bangle-seller community who work 

with precious stones in Mudhol, Karnataka. This is a biographical detail 

woven into the kāvya. The hoods in this verse refer to scholar critics. 23. The literary technique employed here is simhāvalūkana, the casual 

glance the lion throws behind him as he walks along. In poetic 

convention, it refers to flashbacks within the narration. 24. Refers to Kalidāsa's work, Mālavikāgnimitra: 

purāņmityēvanasādhusarvam, nacāpikāvyam navamityavadyam santah parīksyānyatardbhajantē mudhaḥ parapratyayēnabuddiḥ. (1.2) (Everything is not good simply because it is old; nor a poem should be condemned simply because it is new; the wise resort to the one or the other after (proper) examination; [only] a fool has his mind led by 

the judgement of another.) 25. Dikkumaris are celestial maidens in Jaina literature. 26. Kanchuki is a character in Sanskrit drama, usually chief of the palace 

inner chambers. 27. Karaga is a traditional rain ritual, generally performed by women 

carrying water pots on their head. The ritual is also associated with Draupadi. Here too, Draupadi appears to have a wish she would like 

fulfilled. 28. Ranna identifies Bhima with Satyashraya in the previous verse while 

continuing to provide biographical information about him. 29. Refers to Yama, god of death. 30. The verse recalls Bhatta Narayana's seventh century play, Veņīsamhāra 

whose dominant mood or rasa is vīra or heroism. 31. Ranna employs a rare metre here, the Navanalina, or lotus metre. 32. Fires are named according to how they arise, for example: bādabāgni 

(fire from within in the ocean), dāvāgni (a forest fire). 

In poetic conventions, as in this verse, the moon is the enemy of the lotus that blooms in the day. 

In Puranic lore, the vajrāyudha is Indra's weapon made from the 

306 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

backbone of sage Dadhichi, though the weapon is also mentioned in the Rgvēda. Indra used his weapon to cut the wings of mountains which become immobile from then on. 

Canto Two 

1. Time of dissolution. 2. This reference is unclear. 3. The reference is also unclear. 4. Indicates that he is called the hundredth Tailapa. 5. This is an example of a subhāșita (well-spoken), a literary genre of 

advice literature. Many subhāşitas say that wealth is increased when 

wealth is shared, or that a covetous man cannot become a wealthy man. 6. The vidūşaka is the court jester and companion of the king in Sanskrit 

drama. The figure of the vidūşaka can be traced to Bhasa's plays. 7. The sense here is that Bhima is going to kill everyone, rendering lineage 

meaningless. 8. Maruti is Bhima, son of the Wind. The name usually refers to his 

brother, Anjaneya. 9. The vidūşaka is often represented as having a large appetite. Generally, 

people with a large appetite are mocked. 10. Vasus are the eight elemental attendant deities of Indra and Vishnu. In 

the Mahabharata, the Vasus steal the sage Vashistha's cow who curses them to be born on earth as mortals. They request Ganga to be their mother. She will later become the queen of the King Shantanu. Ganga drowned each child to liberate them except for the eighth, Dyaus who 

lived as Bhishma. 11. Refers to Drona. 12. The Mahabharata is described as an ocean by poets including Pampa 

and Nannaya (Pampa's Vikramārjuna Vijayam, 1-17; Nannaya's Adi 

Parva, 1-13. 13. Karna’s representation as a loyal friend continues to be a popular trope. 

South India has tended to be sympathetic to his character, with many 'super-hit' films including Thalapathi (Tamil, 1991), Daana Veera Soora 

Karna (Telugu, 1977) and Karnan (Tamil, 1964) made on him. 14. The verse turns on a pun on the word salya which also means a small 

weapon with an arrow head used to control or kill elephants. 15. Recalls the story of Maitreya who offered Duryodhana advice but was 

met with derision. Duryodhana bared his thigh and slapped it, insulting 

him. 16. Radheya or son of Radha refers to Karna. 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

307 

17. This is also a title for Satyashraya. 18. Ashwatthama quarrelled with Karna who was made chief during the 

war, and threw away his sword. This incident is recorded in Vēņīsamhāra. It also appears in Pampa's Vikramārjuna Vijayam but the sword is not 

thrown down (12.40-5). 19. In Kannada, jõlada pāļi is millet field. A popular Kannada idiom is 

jóladaruņa, implying that to give someone millets is a debt to be repaid. 20. Duryodhana is speaking here about Drona. 21. The implication here is that blacksmiths know their weapons well but 

do not fight with them. 22. Bho here means 'yes, Sir', Dho means alas! 23. Here referring to Brahmins. 24. Ashwatthama appears to be making a distinction in birth between himself 

and Karna. 25. This incident is also mentioned in Bhasa's play Dūtavākyam, Arjuna 

rescues Duryodhana from the clutches of the gandharva, Chitrangada. 26. Arjuna is also called Gandivi because he possesses the Gandiva bow. 27. Ganga is an auspicious river. Kalasha is a water pot used in rituals, im 

plying a strange but auspicious birth. The kalasha is also the pinnacle 

of the temple. 28. Draupadi is called Krishne here as well as in the Mahabharata. The 

svayamvara was a practice of choosing a husband from among a number 

of suitors by a girl of marriageable age. 29. This incident is described in the Bhāgavata Purāņa (10.89-22-66) where 

a Brahmin, who has lost all his sons, pleads with Arjuna to save his 

tenth son. Vows to fight Yama, the God of Death. 30. Madana's enemy is Shiva who gave Arjuna the celestial Pasupata 

weapon. The incident occurs in the Aranyaka Parva, the third book of 

the Mahabharata. 31. In this verse, the author uses krta cleverly and finally says he is 

krtārtha - which means he fulfilled but also that he made it meaningful. 32. In the Puranas and epics, Kubera is a god associated with wealth. 33. Vibhishana is a Chiranjeevi (immortal) and Ravana's brother. 34. Subhadra was Arjuna's wife, daughter of Vasudeva and Rohini, and 

sister to Krishna and Balarama. 35. The abduction of cows, popularly known as gõgrahaņa appears in the 

Virāta Parva, the fourth book of the Mahabharata. 36. Ulupi was the daughter of Kauravya, the king of serpents. The verse 

implies that by winning her, Arjuna also wins fame (kīrti) and victory 

(jayalakṣmi). 37. Ranna emphasizes the word womb here in his employment of imagery 

308 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

as well as the word sahodara to speak of his brothers, who shared the 

same womb and the word vrkodara refers to him. 38. This episode appears in the third book of the Mahabharata. 39. Chaturānana refers to Brahma who has four faces. 

Canto Three 

1. Shakra's son refers to Indira's son, Arjuna. 2. The war was so unnerving that Yama could not help vomiting despite 

eating cumin seeds, a popular digestive. 3. Pritha refers to Kunti, hence Arjuna is called as Partha. But here it 

refers to Bhima. 4. Bhima presented himself as an expert cook at Virata's court, going by 

the name Vallabha in the Virāța Parva. 5. It is popularly believed that a monitor lizard entering the house is a 

bad omen. 6. Ara is a synonym for Dharma in Tamil and Kannada. Ara is an epithet 

for Yama, god of death. He implies that Drona believed his son to be 

dead and went to Yama's abode. 7. Mangaļavāra and kaddavāra (Tuesday and Saturday) are considered 

inauspicious by astrologists because they are ruled by Mars and Saturn 

respectively. 8. Bhagadatta was a character in the Mahabharata known for his skill 

with the elephant. 9. Epithet for Indra. 10. A musical instrument. 11. The moon is referred to as himakrta or snowmaker because of its cooling 

nature. 12. A common idiomatic expression in Kannada and Telugu. 13. Manuja refers to a mortal man and is also an epithet for Arjuna. The 

verse implies that it is extraordinary for a man to be given a position with the gods. Thrilling him - the phrase means to make his hair stand 

on end. 14. Refers to Hanuman who burnt Lanka. 15. Jagadguru literally means Guru of the World. 16. Animēşa means unblinking to refer to gods or fish. One of the avatāras 

of Vishnu is the fish (matsya). 17. Kanjodara, literally lotus in the navel refers to Vishnu. 18. Seragam sārdapan is an idiomatic phrase which refers to unrolling the 

end of the sari to beg for alms. 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

309 

19. Ghatam is an important instrument in Carnatic music that provides the 

tāla. Karade is a folk instrument that is also in the Kavirājamārgam (1.53). It is described as a harsh instrument that is not equal to soph 

isticated instruments like the mrdangam. 20. Nara's son is Abhimanyu. 21. Refers to Drona and his son, Ashvatthama. 22. Bhurisrava was a prince of a minor kingdom in the kingdom of Bahlika. 

He was the grandson of King Bahlika, who was the elder brother of 

Shantanu, king of Hastinapur. 23. Atiratha is a soldier capable of fighting innumerable soldiers. Maharatha 

is one who can fight against ten thousand soldiers. Ardharatha is one 

who can fight against five thousand soldiers (P. Subraya Bhat, 1975). 24. Epithet for Surya, the Sun God. 25. Pingaksha refers to Duryodhana, one with the Red Eye. 26. Refers to Karna, the son of Radha. 27. The seven parts of a kingdom are king, ministers, friends, treasury, 

territory, fortress and army. 28. In the Jaina tradition, three white umbrellas is a royal convention. 29. The three-fold celebrations are nrtya (dance), gīta (song), vādya 

(instrument). 30. Rahu in the form of a serpent swallows the Moon. Here, Rahu refers 

to Bhima. 31. Wielder of the Noose, referring to Yama, god of death. 32. The king bears the burden of the Earth. Without the king, the Adishesha, 

the serpent in the nether world bears the Earth. Here Ranna makes a 

pun on the word sēșa which also means remainder. 33. We may note that Sanjaya is unable to wake him and Duryodhana 

wakes up only when his parents arrive. 

Canto Four 

1. Bhatta Narayana's Venīsamhāra also describes Gandhari as a mother 

who has begotten a hundred sorrows (also in Vikramārjuna Vijayam 

14.8). 2. Upapatti is a term used in Indian logic to mean proof. The term is used 

by Gandhari in Bhatta Narayana's Vēsīsamhāra. Here Ranna employs 

it for Sanjaya who attempts to influence Duryodhana. 3. Recall mention of Yudhishthira's oath earlier. Here Duryodhana responds 

to that oath and defends his desire to die in war. 4. Arjuna received the name Phalguna based on the time of his birth, when310 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

the moon passed through two star-clusters (Purva and Uttara Phalguni) on one day. Phalgunis are famed for entertainment and friendship. 

Ranna's phrase, basirin tegevenu, probably refers to the more common Kannada phrase, hottealliittukondu (literally, to put them in the stomach), hide some Here, Arjuna 'swallowed' Karna while Bhima swallowed Dushasana. The suggestion, following previous verses, is that Yudhishthira would be unable to survive the death of his brothers. Ranna chooses his words carefully again, employing the epithet Yamaraja instead of Dharmaraja in this verse of deadly vengeance. Duryodhana, being close 

to defeat, does not mind joining Yudhishthira in death in such a case. 5. The verse refers to Duryodhana's deceit in the game of dice. Every 

time Yudhishthira threw the dice, he gambled away part of his kingdom. 6. The signs are considered auspicious. 7. Abhimānadhanan (he whose wealth is his pride) is Pampa's epithet for 

Duryodhana. 8. The term for celestial women here is surasundari. Celestial women are 

often depicted on hero stones carrying fallen warriors to Indra's abode. 9. Vidyadharas, literally 'wisdom-holders' are supernatural beings who 

are said to attend to Shiva in the Himalaya, but are also found in Buddhist and Jain sources. They appear in numerous sources where 

they milk the Earth and learn the art of flying. 10. Death is mixture of the macabre and the erotic for warriors. This heaven 

for heroic men is called vīrasvarga. 11. Rasa literally means juice or taste, but in Sanskrit aesthetics refers to 

aestheticized sentiment. In this verse, the base emotion (sthāyībhāva) of rati (eroticism) is transformed into sựngāra, the first of the nine rasas 

and refers to the erotic. 12. Utsāha (enthusiasm) is the base emotion which gives rise to vīra 13. Ranna, the war poet, dramatizes death. According to aesthetic convention, 

death is not meant to be performed on stage. Here, Ranna presents the 

bībhatsa rasa, the rasa of hideousness. 14. This is hāsya rasa which is the rasa of humour. 15. This is karuna rasa (pathos) whose sthayībhāva is soka (permanent 

separation). But after the Buddhist intervention, karuņā (compassion) also became a rasa. The Kavirājamārgam also considers karuņā to be a rasa since the author Srivijaya was a Jain. This does not conform 

with Bharata. 16. Unlike Bharata's eight rasa classification, Ranna includes sānta rasa 

as the ninth rasa. 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

311 

17. Patri, also ele, has the meaning of wheel. Patri here might refer to 

Chariot, rather than to arrows. 18. Madras text of the manuscript refers to 'merchant pishachas'. 19. Gunadhya is author of the Brhatkathā, a large collection of tales. He 

is known to have composed his work in a Prakrit language called paisāci. The intertextual reference here is to ask whether the poet would not be aggrieved by these pishachis who have decided that they too 

can write poetry. 20. This verse has a suggestive quality where Sanjaya restrains Duryodhana 

while simultaneously speaking of a future occurrence where his thighs will indeed be broken. It is as if Sanjaya prevents the narration from 

closing abruptly. 21. Ranna calls the battle between Arjuna and Drona a union between 

lightness and a heavy weight. It mirrors what in Kannada prosody is called 'gurulaghusandhi'. Kannada metrics has short (laghu) and long 

(guru) stresses. 22. Refers to Shiva's bow. 23. Refers to Dhrishtadhyumna, meaning strong by birth. 24. The suggestion here being that his enemies die but his students survive 

in war. 25. The verse implies that he was a hero from childhood. Many folk stories 

there is a motif of mothers feeding their child and telling them heroic 

stories. 26. Bhishma is the great patriarch who led the Kurus for the first ten days. 27. Duryodhana's son is not mentioned in Vyasa's Mahabharata. This is 

likely a folk influence. 28. Refers to Indra 29. Karna's son. 30. Nakula also means mongoose. 

Canto Five 

1. Srikanta refers here to Vishnu, the husband of Sri (Lakshmi). Vasudeva 

is an important part of the Jaina tradition too. Satyashraya also patronized smārtas who worshipped both Shiva and Vishnu, but are partial to 

Shiva. 2. Here, Sanjaya tries to capture Duryodhana's attention by taking Bhima's 

name first, and repeating it continually, marking a shift away from the previous chapter of lamentation. 

312 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

3. Jīva, māmsa, rakta, sira, kāya are five parts of him that correspond to 

the five elements: prthivāpastējāvāyurākāśa 4. The Sanskrit phrase, gandasyöparisphoțakam, recalls a common Kannada 

phrase too, adu kuruvinabokke. 5. Duryodhana addresses Karna, his intimate friend, as Lord of Anga 

country. Even in death, Duryodhana addresses him by this royal epithet, bestowing honour on his friend, whom it was commonly known, was the son of a charioteer. Ranna emphasizes this honour by repeating the last word of the stanza in many verses in Duryodhana's lament. Pampa provides the characteristic features of each character in his poem, where he describes Karna as having nanni or the quality of friendship, 

nanniyoļinatanayan. Ranna uses Kannada words to suggest intimacy. 6. Rta is the Vedic word for truth. Kannada uses words like sullu and 

asatya for ansta. Conventional usage determines that rta has to be 

followed, unlike words like not nija or satya. 7. Refers to Krishna. 8. This curious verse refers to the truth of Karna's birth, which Kunti hid 

from the Pandavas. Here too, we may refer to Pampa's verse, 9.66 where he explains how Duryodhana came to know that Karna was 

indeed the eldest Pandava and son of Surya, the Sun-god. 9. The weapon refers to the fire weapon which was given by Shiva. 10. The Earth held fast to Karna's chariot. 11. Refers to Surya. 12. An advisor is a narmasaciva who appears in other matters as well. 13. Ranna provides us with different words for advisors in this verse. 14. The suggestion lies in Karna's full Moon face being the reflection of 

his father, the Sun (tarani tanaya). Since the Moon influences the tide, 

the memory of Karna causes Duryodhana's grief to rise. 15. Karuņa rasa with sāka as sthāyībhava is the early form of Bharata's 

rasa theory. It later transforms into karuņā under the influence of the Buddhists. Sanjaya realizes that death has cast a shadow on Duryodhana. 

To pull him out of his grief, he turns him in the direction of Bhishma. 16. The emphasis is on the elevated birth of Bhishma as compared to 

Duryodhana's birth from Gandhari, a mortal woman. 17. Popular term for grandfather. 18. Dhavala is a folk song with native metres. 19. Atri is known as one among the seven vedic sages, and also appears 

in the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics. 20. Some assume Bhārata belongs to line of Dushyanta and Shakuntala's 

son. Here Bharata's father is called Satya. 21. This verse is like a subhashita (advice literature). 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

313 

Canto Six 

1. Mangalamahāśrī is a metre which is the final among vrtta metres which 

have up to 26 syllables. Mangala means auspicious and the metre is sometimes used at the end of epics. Here too, mangalamahāśrī is used 

in the sense of an ending. 2. Ranna puns on the word 'śēşa' meaning the remaining one. He uses 

the word with different prefixes to give different meanings. 3. Bhishma taught Jalamantra, literally water-spell, to Duryodhana which 

enabled him to hold his breath under water. 4. Mattar is a measure. Ranna follows Vēnīsamhāra where Duryodhana 

hesitates to enter the lake, taking one step forward and four steps back. 5. This verse is usually acknowledged to be a key verse in the Gadāyuddha. 

Ranna may also be inspired by Bana's Kādambarī which contains an 

elaborate description of the accchödda lake. 6. The ācamana is a ritual practice of sipping water for purifying purposes. 7. This verse is present only in the manuscript of the Mysore Institute of 

Kannada Studies, Mysore University. The next verse appears to be an 

interpolation. 8. The god of the western direction. 9. Refers to the gods. 10. The world under the earth is called pātāla. It is constituted of seven 

realms known as atala, vitala, sutala, talātala, mahātala, rasātala and 

the lowest one, called pātāla is the abode of the snakes. 11. The cosmological term is brahmānda. 12. Ajatashatru refers to Yudhishthira who has no enemy. 13. This expression is significant. In the Virāța Parva of the Mahabharata, 

while the Pandavas are in hiding in their final year of exile, Bhima is tempted to uproot a tree when Susarman threatens the Virata king but 

is cautioned against doing so by Yudhishthira. 14. This line recalls the first act of Bhatta Narayana's Vēnīsamhāra. 15. We may speculate that the mention of Rudhirodgari and allusion to the 

red eyed one (also, Raktakshi) may refer to the final years of the 60 year calendar. These years allude to destruction and follow each other. Perhaps Ranna is speaking of the closeness of the cousins as well as 

the dissolving years that spell an end. 16. Dimensions of the Kurukshetra battle. 17. Akşõhiņi refers to an army constituted by elephants, horses, chariots 

and soldiers. 18. Shiva's enemy is Manmatha, the god of love. 

314 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

Canto Seven 

1. A common proverb that persists in Kannada till today: nīnuondannna 

bagedare vidhi tānondannna bagedattu – man proposes, god disposes. 2. In Kannada, a show of strength is popularly expressed as ninage 

nīrukudistīni or You will be compelled to drink water. 3. This verse recalls Sage Agastya who drank the oceans up to expose 

demons hiding in the waters. 4. In Canto 5 v. 64 - Duryodhana says this to Bhishma. Now Bhima asks 

the same question in this verse. 5. Subraya Bhat (1956, 7.18, Commentary) notes that Ranna's home town 

is famous for peanuts. 6. T.N. Sreekanthaiah suggests that this verse is popular in Kannada 

literature for its suggestive quality (Bhāratīya kāvya mīmāmse, 4th edn., 

1973, p. 199). 7. Duryodhana is comparing Bhima to Hiranyaksha. This verse recalls 

Hiranyaksha, brother of Hiranyakashipu, who rolled the Earth like a mat, tucked it under his armpit and went to rasātala. Rasātala is the 

lowest level of nether regions inhabited by serpents. 8. Hari refers to Indra in this verse. 9. Kritanta refers to Yama, god of death. 10. Ranna borrows this phrase from Pampa in whose work we find, nērpinge 

nērpugoļlade māņen (11.7). 11. Ranna plays on the word "Janaradana’. Janaradana is an epithet of 

Vishnu to mean one who protects people. Janardana can also mean one 

who has caused harm to people. 12. Krishna took the form of Mohini in the distribution of ambrosia. 13. Krishna killed Shishupala with his discus and the elephant that Kamsa 

sent his way. 14. The word dharma is usually said to be untranslatable. Here, Ranna uses 

the word ara in place of dharma. Though not used in Kannada today, 

Ara is also a Tamil word meaning dharma. 15. Bhima is called the middle born/madhyama, likely influenced by Bhasa, 

the Sanskrit playwright who wrote the well-known Sanskrit play, Madhyama Vyayoga. Bhima is the second among the five sons, but 

among Kunti's sons, he is the middle son. 

Canto Eight 

1. Angula, whose common meaning is finger is a measurement equal to 

eight yava millet grains. 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

315 

2. These poses are also mentioned in Nātyaśāstra, a treatise on drama in 

the section on 32 Angaragas (170-239). 3. The suggestion is that copper becomes hot quickly. 4. The verse suggests the redness of dawn and twilight. 5. Ranna brings events of his time into the story. 6. The pun is on the meaning of his name, Dur-yuddha, one who cannot 

be conquered. 7. The moving wheel is a captivating motif, from the Ashoka chakra to 

everyday Kannada as well. For example, the phrase chakra tirugista 

iddane (he is spinning his wheel) means causing something to happen. 8. The thunderbolt is the nail in his chariot, and the lightning flashes are 

sparks from the moving chariot. 9. The description of thighs as banana stems is usually used to describe 

women. 10. As a cultural practice, the use of the left is considered improper. 11. In the Mahabharata, Baladeva rebukes Bhima soundly, Baladeva and 

Vasudeva are closely associated revered figures for the Jains. 12. Aruna, son of Vinata born as an egg. The egg was broken by his mother, 

and he was born with deformed thighs and became the charioteer of 

the Sun. 13. Bhima is in angry, raudra mood and she is arousing love in him. Smara 

had no body, Krishne gave sanjīvani and brought him to life. Bhima 

and Satyashraya are brought together in the Chalukya Kandarpa. 14. The box here is a religiously significant karadi in which the linga is 

placed. 15. The verse is reminiscent of a yantra that seeks to compel action. 16. The suggestion is that Manmatha and his five arrows are unnecessary 

because of her five-fold beauty. 17. Kama, here Angodbhava is said to take birth in a person, hence inflaming 

them with love. 18. This verse is reminiscent of the customary āyudha pāja during Navaratri 

when weapons are worshipped. 

Canto Nine 

1. Satyanilaya is a play on his patron's name, Satyashraya, where aśraya 

like nilaya means dwelling. 2. Ashwatthama bears Shiva's features since he is said to be his incarnation. 3. The verse is composed in Prithvi metre. 4. Rajoguna among the three dispositions refers to the quality of passion. 

316 

NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 

5. Probably refers to Dhanvantari, the god of medicine. 6. Āpōšana is a ritual gesture of drinking water in the palm with the thumb 

placed between pointer and middle finger. 7. The verse refers to the South Indian calendar. The 15th of the month 

is paurņami of the ascending fortnight. The following fortnight ends on amāvāsya. Amāvāsya is an inauspicious day for people in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh though considered auspicious by Tamilians. The difference in calendars between the north and south is apparent in the śuddhadinam which begins from the first day of the ascending moon for South Indians. For North Indians, suddha begins from paurnami or the descending Moon. 

Canto Ten 

1. Kinnaras are celestial guards with bodies of men with heads of horses. 

Kinnara here could also be a pun in Sanskrit kim nara? (Is it a battle 

between human beings?). 2. Bhairava is a destructive form of Shiva. 3. Java refers to Yama. 4. Refers to Indra who is lord of the gods. 5. The sētu is considered the boundary in the south.
